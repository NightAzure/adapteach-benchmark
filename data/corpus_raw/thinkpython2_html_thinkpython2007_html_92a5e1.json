But the functions we’ve written\nare all void: they have an effect, like printing a value\nor moving a turtle, but they don’t have a return value. In\nthis chapter you will learn to write fruitful functions. 6.1  Return values Calling the function generates a return\nvalue, which we usually assign to a variable or use as part of an\nexpression. e = math.exp(1.0)\nheight = radius * math.sin(radians) The functions we have written so far are void. Speaking casually,\nthey have no return value; more precisely,\ntheir return value is None . In this chapter, we are (finally) going to write fruitful functions.\nThe first example is area , which returns the area of a circle\nwith the given radius: def area(radius):\n    a = math.pi * radius**2\n    return a We have seen the return statement before, but in a fruitful\nfunction the return statement includes\nan expression. This statement means: “Return immediately from\nthis function and use the following expression as a return value.”\nThe expression can be arbitrarily complicated, so we could\nhave written this function more concisely: def area(radius):\n    return math.pi * radius**2 On the other hand, temporary variables like a can make\ndebugging easier. Sometimes it is useful to have multiple return statements, one in each\nbranch of a conditional: def absolute_value(x):\n    if x < 0:\n        return -x\n    else:\n        return x Since these return statements are in an alternative conditional,\nonly one runs. As soon as a return statement runs, the function\nterminates without executing any subsequent statements.\nCode that appears after a return statement, or any other place\nthe flow of execution can never reach, is called dead code . In a fruitful function, it is a good idea to ensure\nthat every possible path through the program hits a return statement. For example: def absolute_value(x):\n    if x < 0:\n        return -x\n    if x > 0:\n        return x This function is incorrect because if x happens to be 0,\nneither condition is true, and the function ends without hitting a return statement. If the flow of execution gets to the end\nof a function, the return value is None , which is not\nthe absolute value of 0. >>> print(absolute_value(0))\nNone By the way, Python provides a built-in function called abs that computes absolute values. As an exercise, write a compare function that\ntakes two values, x and y , and returns 1 if x > y , 0 if x == y , and -1 if x < y . 6.2  Incremental development As you write larger functions, you might find yourself\nspending more time debugging. To deal with increasingly complex programs,\nyou might want to try a process called incremental development . The goal of incremental development\nis to avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only\na small amount of code at a time. As an example, suppose you want to find the distance between two\npoints, given by the coordinates ( x 1 , y 1 ) and ( x 2 , y 2 ).\nBy the Pythagorean theorem, the distance is: distance = √ ( x 2 − x 1 ) 2 + ( y 2 − y 1 ) 2 The first step is to consider what a distance function should\nlook like in Python. In other words, what are the inputs (parameters)\nand what is the output (return value)? In this case, the inputs are two points, which you can represent\nusing four numbers. The return value is the distance represented by\na floating-point value. Immediately you can write an outline of the function: def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    return 0.0 Obviously, this version doesn’t compute distances; it always returns\nzero. But it is syntactically correct, and it runs, which means that\nyou can test it before you make it more complicated. To test the new function, call it with sample arguments: >>> distance(1, 2, 4, 6)\n0.0 I chose these values so that the horizontal distance is 3 and the\nvertical distance is 4; that way, the result is 5, the hypotenuse \nof a 3-4-5 right triangle. When testing a function, it is\nuseful to know the right answer. At this point we have confirmed that the function is syntactically\ncorrect, and we can start adding code to the body.\nA reasonable next step is to find the differences x 2 − x 1 and y 2 − y 1 . The next version stores those values in\ntemporary variables and prints them. def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n    print('dx is', dx)\n    print('dy is', dy)\n    return 0.0 If the function is working, it should display dx is 3 and dy is 4 . If so, we know that the function is getting the right\narguments and performing the first computation correctly. If not,\nthere are only a few lines to check. Next we compute the sum of squares of dx and dy : def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2\n    print('dsquared is: ', dsquared)\n    return 0.0 Again, you would run the program at this stage and check the output\n(which should be 25).\nFinally, you can use math.sqrt to compute and return the result: def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    dx = x2 - x1\n    dy = y2 - y1\n    dsquared = dx**2 + dy**2\n    result = math.sqrt(dsquared)\n    return result If that works correctly, you are done. Otherwise, you might\nwant to print the value of result before the return\nstatement. The final version of the function doesn’t display anything when it\nruns; it only returns a value. The print statements we wrote\nare useful for debugging, but once you get the function working, you\nshould remove them. Code like that is called scaffolding because it is helpful for building the program but is not part of the\nfinal product. When you start out, you should add only a line or two of code at a\ntime. As you gain more experience, you might find yourself writing\nand debugging bigger chunks. Either way, incremental development\ncan save you a lot of debugging time. The key aspects of the process are: Start with a working program and make small incremental changes. \nAt any point, if there is an error, you should have a good idea\nwhere it is. Use variables to hold intermediate values so you can\ndisplay and check them. Once the program is working, you might want to remove some of\nthe scaffolding or consolidate multiple statements into compound\nexpressions, but only if it does not make the program difficult to\nread. As an exercise, use incremental development to write a function\ncalled hypotenuse that returns the length of the hypotenuse of a\nright triangle given the lengths of the other two legs as arguments.\nRecord each stage of the development process as you go. 6.3  Composition As you should expect by now, you can call one function from within\nanother. As an example, we’ll write a function that takes two points,\nthe center of the circle and a point on the perimeter, and computes\nthe area of the circle. Assume that the center point is stored in the variables xc and yc , and the perimeter point is in xp and yp . The\nfirst step is to find the radius of the circle, which is the distance\nbetween the two points. We just wrote a function, distance , that does that: radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp) The next step is to find the area of a circle with that radius;\nwe just wrote that, too: result = area(radius) Encapsulating these steps in a function, we get: def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp):\n    radius = distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)\n    result = area(radius)\n    return result The temporary variables radius and result are useful for\ndevelopment and debugging, but once the program is working, we can\nmake it more concise by composing the function calls: def circle_area(xc, yc, xp, yp):\n    return area(distance(xc, yc, xp, yp)) 6.4  Boolean functions Functions can return booleans, which is often convenient for hiding\ncomplicated tests inside functions. For example: def is_divisible(x, y):\n    if x % y == 0:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False It is common to give boolean functions names that sound like yes/no\nquestions; is_divisible returns either True or False to indicate whether x is divisible by y . Here is an example: >>> is_divisible(6, 4)\nFalse\n>>> is_divisible(6, 3)\nTrue The result of the == operator is a boolean, so we can write the\nfunction more concisely by returning it directly: def is_divisible(x, y):\n    return x % y == 0 Boolean functions are often used in conditional statements: if is_divisible(x, y):\n    print('x is divisible by y') It might be tempting to write something like: if is_divisible(x, y) == True:\n    print('x is divisible by y') But the extra comparison is unnecessary. As an exercise, write a function is_between(x, y, z) that\nreturns True if x ≤ y ≤ z or False otherwise. 6.5  More recursion We have only covered a small subset of Python, but you might\nbe interested to know that this subset is a complete programming language, which means that anything that can be\ncomputed can be expressed in this language. Any program ever written\ncould be rewritten using only the language features you have learned\nso far (actually, you would need a few commands to control devices\nlike the mouse, disks, etc., but that’s all). Proving that claim is a nontrivial exercise first accomplished by Alan\nTuring, one of the first computer scientists (some would argue that he\nwas a mathematician, but a lot of early computer scientists started as\nmathematicians). Accordingly, it is known as the Turing Thesis.\nFor a more complete (and accurate) discussion of the Turing Thesis,\nI recommend Michael Sipser’s book Introduction to the\nTheory of Computation . To give you an idea of what you can do with the tools you have learned\nso far, we’ll evaluate a few recursively defined mathematical\nfunctions. A recursive definition is similar to a circular\ndefinition, in the sense that the definition contains a reference to\nthe thing being defined. A truly circular definition is not very\nuseful: vorpal: An adjective used to describe something that is vorpal. If you saw that definition in the dictionary, you might be annoyed. On\nthe other hand, if you looked up the definition of the factorial\nfunction, denoted with the symbol !, you might get something like\nthis: 0! = 1 n ! = n ( n −1)! This definition says that the factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial\nof any other value, n , is n multiplied by the factorial of n −1. So 3! is 3 times 2!, which is 2 times 1!, which is 1 times\n0!. Putting it all together, 3! equals 3 times 2 times 1 times 1,\nwhich is 6. If you can write a recursive definition of something, you can\nwrite a Python program to evaluate it. The first step is to decide\nwhat the parameters should be. In this case it should be clear\nthat factorial takes an integer: def factorial(n): If the argument happens to be 0, all we have to do is return 1: def factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1 Otherwise, and this is the interesting part, we have to make a\nrecursive call to find the factorial of n −1 and then multiply it by n : def factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        recurse = factorial(n-1)\n        result = n * recurse\n        return result The flow of execution for this program is similar to the flow of countdown in Section 5.8 . If we call factorial with the value 3: Since 3 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial\nof n-1 ... Since 2 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial of n-1 ... Since 1 is not 0, we take the second branch and calculate the factorial\nof n-1 ... Since 0 equals 0, we take the first branch and return 1\nwithout making any more recursive calls. The return value, 1, is multiplied by n , which is 1, and the\nresult is returned. The return value, 1, is multiplied by n , which is 2, and the\nresult is returned. The return value (2) is multiplied by n , which is 3, and the result, 6,\nbecomes the return value of the function call that started the whole\nprocess. Figure 6.1 shows what the stack diagram looks like for\nthis sequence of function calls. Figure 6.1: Stack diagram. The return values are shown being passed back up the stack. In each\nframe, the return value is the value of result , which is the\nproduct of n and recurse . In the last frame, the local\nvariables recurse and result do not exist, because\nthe branch that creates them does not run. 6.6  Leap of faith Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but\nit can quickly become overwhelming. An\nalternative is what I call the “leap of faith”. When you come to a\nfunction call, instead of following the flow of execution, you assume that the function works correctly and returns the right\nresult. In fact, you are already practicing this leap of faith when you use\nbuilt-in functions. When you call math.cos or math.exp ,\nyou don’t examine the bodies of those functions. You just\nassume that they work because the people who wrote the built-in\nfunctions were good programmers. The same is true when you call one of your own functions. For\nexample, in Section 6.4 , we wrote a function called is_divisible that determines whether one number is divisible by\nanother. Once we have convinced ourselves that this function is\ncorrect—by examining the code and testing—we can use the function\nwithout looking at the body again. The same is true of recursive programs. When you get to the recursive\ncall, instead of following the flow of execution, you should assume\nthat the recursive call works (returns the correct result) and then ask\nyourself, “Assuming that I can find the factorial of n −1, can I\ncompute the factorial of n ?” It is clear that you\ncan, by multiplying by n . Of course, it’s a bit strange to assume that the function works\ncorrectly when you haven’t finished writing it, but that’s why\nit’s called a leap of faith! 6.7  One more example After factorial , the most common example of a recursively\ndefined mathematical function is fibonacci , which has the\nfollowing definition (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number ): fibonacci (0) = 0 fibonacci (1) = 1 fibonacci ( n ) = fibonacci ( n −1) + fibonacci ( n −2) Translated into Python, it looks like this: def fibonacci(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif  n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) If you try to follow the flow of execution here, even for fairly\nsmall values of n , your head explodes. But according to the\nleap of faith, if you assume that the two recursive calls\nwork correctly, then it is clear that you get\nthe right result by adding them together. 6.8  Checking types What happens if we call factorial and give it 1.5 as an argument? >>> factorial(1.5)\nRuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded It looks like an infinite recursion. How can that be? The function\nhas a base case—when n == 0 . But if n is not an integer,\nwe can miss the base case and recurse forever. In the first recursive call, the value of n is 0.5.\nIn the next, it is -0.5. From there, it gets smaller\n(more negative), but it will never be 0. We have two choices. We can try to generalize the factorial function to work with floating-point numbers, or we can make factorial check the type of its argument. The first option is\ncalled the gamma function and it’s a\nlittle beyond the scope of this book. So we’ll go for the second. We can use the built-in function isinstance to verify the type\nof the argument. While we’re at it, we can also make sure the\nargument is positive: def factorial(n):\n    if not isinstance(n, int):\n        print('Factorial is only defined for integers.')\n        return None\n    elif n < 0:\n        print('Factorial is not defined for negative integers.')\n        return None\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n-1) The first base case handles nonintegers; the\nsecond handles negative integers. In both cases, the program prints\nan error message and returns None to indicate that something\nwent wrong: >>> print(factorial('fred'))\nFactorial is only defined for integers.\nNone\n>>> print(factorial(-2))\nFactorial is not defined for negative integers.\nNone If we get past both checks, we know that n is a non-negative integer, so we can prove that the recursion terminates. This program demonstrates a pattern sometimes called a guardian .\nThe first two conditionals act as guardians, protecting the code that\nfollows from values that might cause an error. The guardians make it\npossible to prove the correctness of the code. In Section 11.4 we will see a more flexible alternative to printing\nan error message: raising an exception. 6.9  Debugging Breaking a large program into smaller functions creates natural\ncheckpoints for debugging. If a function is not\nworking, there are three possibilities to consider: There is something wrong with the arguments the function\nis getting; a precondition is violated. There is something wrong with the function; a postcondition\nis violated. There is something wrong with the return value or the\nway it is being used. To rule out the first possibility, you can add a print statement\nat the beginning of the function and display the values of the\nparameters (and maybe their types). Or you can write code\nthat checks the preconditions explicitly. If the parameters look good, add a print statement before each return statement and display the return value. If\npossible, check the result by hand. Consider calling the\nfunction with values that make it easy to check the result\n(as in Section 6.2 ). If the function seems to be working, look at the function call\nto make sure the return value is being used correctly (or used\nat all!). Adding print statements at the beginning and end of a function\ncan help make the flow of execution more visible.\nFor example, here is a version of factorial with\nprint statements: def factorial(n):\n    space = ' ' * (4 * n)\n    print(space, 'factorial', n)\n    if n == 0:\n        print(space, 'returning 1')\n        return 1\n    else:\n        recurse = factorial(n-1)\n        result = n * recurse\n        print(space, 'returning', result)\n        return result space is a string of space characters that controls the\nindentation of the output. Here is the result of factorial(4) : factorial 4\n             factorial 3\n         factorial 2\n     factorial 1\n factorial 0\n returning 1\n     returning 1\n         returning 2\n             returning 6\n                 returning 24 If you are confused about the flow of execution, this kind of\noutput can be helpful. It takes some time to develop effective\nscaffolding, but a little bit of scaffolding can save a lot of debugging. 6.10  Glossary temporary variable: A variable used to store an intermediate value in\na complex calculation. dead code: Part of a program that can never run, often because\nit appears after a return statement. incremental development: A program development plan intended to\navoid debugging by adding and testing only\na small amount of code at a time. scaffolding: Code that is used during program development but is\nnot part of the final version. guardian: A programming pattern that uses a conditional\nstatement to check for and handle circumstances that\nmight cause an error. 6.11  Exercises Exercise 1 Draw a stack diagram for the following program. What does the program print? def b(z):\n    prod = a(z, z)\n    print(z, prod)\n    return prod\n\ndef a(x, y):\n    x = x + 1\n    return x * y\n\ndef c(x, y, z):\n    total = x + y + z\n    square = b(total)**2\n    return square\n\nx = 1\ny = x + 1\nprint(c(x, y+3, x+y)) Exercise 2 The Ackermann function, A ( m , n ) , is defined: A ( m , n ) = ⎧ ⎪ ⎨ ⎪ ⎩ n +1 if m = 0 A ( m −1, 1) if m > 0  and n = 0 A ( m −1, A ( m , n −1)) if m > 0  and n > 0. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function .\nWrite a function named ack that evaluates the Ackermann function.\nUse your function to evaluate ack(3, 4) , which should be 125.\nWhat happens for larger values of m and n ?\nSolution: https://thinkpython.com/code/ackermann.py . Exercise 3 A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same backward and\nforward, like “noon” and “redivider”. Recursively, a word\nis a palindrome if the first and last letters are the same\nand the middle is a palindrome. The following are functions that take a string argument and\nreturn the first, last, and middle letters: def first(word):\n    return word[0]\n\ndef last(word):\n    return word[-1]\n\ndef middle(word):\n    return word[1:-1] We’ll see how they work in Chapter 8 . Type these functions into a file named palindrome.py and test them out. What happens if you call middle with\na string with two letters? One letter? What about the empty\nstring, which is written '' and contains no letters? Write a function called is_palindrome that takes\na string argument and returns True if it is a palindrome\nand False otherwise. Remember that you can use the\nbuilt-in function len to check the length of a string. Solution: https://thinkpython.com/code/palindrome_soln.py . Exercise 4 A number, a , is a power of b if it is divisible by b and a / b is a power of b . Write a function called is_power that takes parameters a and b and returns True if a is a power of b .\nNote: you will have to think about the base case. Exercise 5 The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is the largest number\nthat divides both of them with no remainder. One way to find the GCD of two numbers is based on the observation\nthat if r is the remainder when a is divided by b , then gcd ( a , b ) = gcd ( b , r ) . As a base case, we can use gcd ( a , 0) = a . Write a function called gcd that takes parameters a and b and returns their greatest common divisor.
