  "content": "# 5.Data StructuresÂ¶\n\nThis chapter describes some things youâve learned about already in more detail,\nand adds some new things as well.\n\n## 5.1.More on ListsÂ¶\n\nThe list data type has some more methods. Here are all\nof the methods of list objects:\n\nlist.\nappend\n(\nx\n)\nAdd an item to the end of the list.  Similar to a[len(a):] = [x] .\n\nlist.\nextend\n(\niterable\n)\nExtend the list by appending all the items from the iterable.  Similar to a[len(a):] = iterable .\n\nlist.\ninsert\n(\ni\n,\nx\n)\nInsert an item at a given position.  The first argument is the index of the\nelement before which to insert, so a.insert(0, x) inserts at the front of\nthe list, and a.insert(len(a), x) is equivalent to a.append(x) .\n\nlist.\nremove\n(\nx\n)\nRemove the first item from the list whose value is equal to x .  It raises a ValueError if there is no such item.\n\nlist.\npop\n(\n[\ni\n]\n)\nRemove the item at the given position in the list, and return it.  If no index\nis specified, a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list.\nIt raises an IndexError if the list is empty or the index is\noutside the list range.\n\nlist.\nclear\n(\n)\nRemove all items from the list.  Similar to del a[:] .\n\nlist.\nindex\n(\nx\n[\n,\nstart\n[\n,\nend\n]\n]\n)\nReturn zero-based index of the first occurrence of x in the list.\nRaises a ValueError if there is no such item.\n\nThe optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in the slice\nnotation and are used to limit the search to a particular subsequence of\nthe list.  The returned index is computed relative to the beginning of the full\nsequence rather than the start argument.\n\nlist.\ncount\n(\nx\n)\nReturn the number of times x appears in the list.\n\nlist.\nsort\n(\n*\n,\nkey\n=\nNone\n,\nreverse\n=\nFalse\n)\nSort the items of the list in place (the arguments can be used for sort\ncustomization, see sorted() for their explanation).\n\nlist.\nreverse\n(\n)\nReverse the elements of the list in place.\n\nlist.\ncopy\n(\n)\nReturn a shallow copy of the list.  Similar to a[:] .\n\nAn example that uses most of the list methods:\n\n```python\n>>> fruits = ['orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'banana', 'kiwi', 'apple', 'banana']\n>>> fruits.count('apple')\n2\n>>> fruits.count('tangerine')\n0\n>>> fruits.index('banana')\n3\n>>> fruits.index('banana', 4)  # Find next banana starting at position 4\n6\n>>> fruits.reverse()\n>>> fruits\n['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple', 'orange']\n>>> fruits.append('grape')\n>>> fruits\n['banana', 'apple', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple', 'orange', 'grape']\n>>> fruits.sort()\n>>> fruits\n['apple', 'apple', 'banana', 'banana', 'grape', 'kiwi', 'orange', 'pear']\n>>> fruits.pop()\n'pear'\n```\n\nYou might have noticed that methods like insert , remove or sort that\nonly modify the list have no return value printed â they return the default None . [ 1 ] This is a design principle for all mutable data structures in\nPython.\n\nAnother thing you might notice is that not all data can be sorted or\ncompared.  For instance, [None, 'hello', 10] doesnât sort because\nintegers canât be compared to strings and None canât be compared to\nother types.  Also, there are some types that donât have a defined\nordering relation.  For example, 3+4j < 5+7j isnât a valid\ncomparison.\n\n### 5.1.1.Using Lists as StacksÂ¶\n\nThe list methods make it very easy to use a list as a stack, where the last\nelement added is the first element retrieved (âlast-in, first-outâ).  To add an\nitem to the top of the stack, use append() .  To retrieve an item from the\ntop of the stack, use pop() without an explicit index.  For example:\n\n```python\n>>> stack = [3, 4, 5]\n>>> stack.append(6)\n>>> stack.append(7)\n>>> stack\n[3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n>>> stack.pop()\n7\n>>> stack\n[3, 4, 5, 6]\n>>> stack.pop()\n6\n>>> stack.pop()\n5\n>>> stack\n[3, 4]\n```\n\n### 5.1.2.Using Lists as QueuesÂ¶\n\nIt is also possible to use a list as a queue, where the first element added is\nthe first element retrieved (âfirst-in, first-outâ); however, lists are not\nefficient for this purpose.  While appends and pops from the end of list are\nfast, doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow (because all\nof the other elements have to be shifted by one).\n\nTo implement a queue, use collections.deque which was designed to\nhave fast appends and pops from both ends.  For example:\n\n```python\n>>> from collections import deque\n>>> queue = deque([\"Eric\", \"John\", \"Michael\"])\n>>> queue.append(\"Terry\")           # Terry arrives\n>>> queue.append(\"Graham\")          # Graham arrives\n>>> queue.popleft()                 # The first to arrive now leaves\n'Eric'\n>>> queue.popleft()                 # The second to arrive now leaves\n'John'\n>>> queue                           # Remaining queue in order of arrival\ndeque(['Michael', 'Terry', 'Graham'])\n```\n\n### 5.1.3.List ComprehensionsÂ¶\n\nList comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.\nCommon applications are to make new lists where each element is the result of\nsome operations applied to each member of another sequence or iterable, or to\ncreate a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.\n\nFor example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like:\n\n```python\n>>> squares = []\n>>> for x in range(10):\n...     squares.append(x**2)\n...\n>>> squares\n[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\n```\n\nNote that this creates (or overwrites) a variable named x that still exists\nafter the loop completes.  We can calculate the list of squares without any\nside effects using:\n\n```python\nsquares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(10)))\n```\n\nor, equivalently:\n\n```python\nsquares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n```\n\nwhich is more concise and readable.\n\nA list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed\nby a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses.  The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression\nin the context of the for and if clauses which follow it.\nFor example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they are not\nequal:\n\n```python\n>>> [(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]\n[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]\n```\n\nand itâs equivalent to:\n\n```python\n>>> combs = []\n>>> for x in [1,2,3]:\n...     for y in [3,1,4]:\n...         if x != y:\n...             combs.append((x, y))\n...\n>>> combs\n[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]\n```\n\nNote how the order of the for and if statements is the\nsame in both these snippets.\n\nIf the expression is a tuple (e.g. the (x, y) in the previous example),\nit must be parenthesized.\n\n```python\n>>> vec = [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]\n>>> # create a new list with the values doubled\n>>> [x*2 for x in vec]\n[-8, -4, 0, 4, 8]\n>>> # filter the list to exclude negative numbers\n>>> [x for x in vec if x >= 0]\n[0, 2, 4]\n>>> # apply a function to all the elements\n>>> [abs(x) for x in vec]\n[4, 2, 0, 2, 4]\n>>> # call a method on each element\n>>> freshfruit = ['  banana', '  loganberry ', 'passion fruit  ']\n>>> [weapon.strip() for weapon in freshfruit]\n['banana', 'loganberry', 'passion fruit']\n>>> # create a list of 2-tuples like (number, square)\n>>> [(x, x**2) for x in range(6)]\n[(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)]\n>>> # the tuple must be parenthesized, otherwise an error is raised\n>>> [x, x**2 for x in range(6)]\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n    [x, x**2 for x in range(6)]\n     ^^^^^^^\nSyntaxError: did you forget parentheses around the comprehension target?\n>>> # flatten a list using a listcomp with two 'for'\n>>> vec = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]\n>>> [num for elem in vec for num in elem]\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n```\n\nList comprehensions can contain complex expressions and nested functions:\n\n```python\n>>> from math import pi\n>>> [str(round(pi, i)) for i in range(1, 6)]\n['3.1', '3.14', '3.142', '3.1416', '3.14159']\n```\n\n### 5.1.4.Nested List ComprehensionsÂ¶\n\nThe initial expression in a list comprehension can be any arbitrary expression,\nincluding another list comprehension.\n\nConsider the following example of a 3x4 matrix implemented as a list of\n3 lists of length 4:\n\n```python\n>>> matrix = [\n...     [1, 2, 3, 4],\n...     [5, 6, 7, 8],\n...     [9, 10, 11, 12],\n... ]\n```\n\nThe following list comprehension will transpose rows and columns:\n\n```python\n>>> [[row[i] for row in matrix] for i in range(4)]\n[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]\n```\n\nAs we saw in the previous section, the inner list comprehension is evaluated in\nthe context of the for that follows it, so this example is\nequivalent to:\n\n```python\n>>> transposed = []\n>>> for i in range(4):\n...     transposed.append([row[i] for row in matrix])\n...\n>>> transposed\n[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]\n```\n\nwhich, in turn, is the same as:\n\n```python\n>>> transposed = []\n>>> for i in range(4):\n...     # the following 3 lines implement the nested listcomp\n...     transposed_row = []\n...     for row in matrix:\n...         transposed_row.append(row[i])\n...     transposed.append(transposed_row)\n...\n>>> transposed\n[[1, 5, 9], [2, 6, 10], [3, 7, 11], [4, 8, 12]]\n```\n\nIn the real world, you should prefer built-in functions to complex flow statements.\nThe zip() function would do a great job for this use case:\n\n```python\n>>> list(zip(*matrix))\n[(1, 5, 9), (2, 6, 10), (3, 7, 11), (4, 8, 12)]\n```\n\nSee Unpacking Argument Lists for details on the asterisk in this line.\n\n## 5.2.ThedelstatementÂ¶\n\nThere is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its\nvalue: the del statement.  This differs from the pop() method\nwhich returns a value.  The del statement can also be used to remove\nslices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did earlier by assignment\nof an empty list to the slice).  For example:\n\n```python\n>>> a = [-1, 1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]\n>>> del a[0]\n>>> a\n[1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]\n>>> del a[2:4]\n>>> a\n[1, 66.25, 1234.5]\n>>> del a[:]\n>>> a\n[]\n```\n\ndel can also be used to delete entire variables:\n\n```python\n>>> del a\n```\n\nReferencing the name a hereafter is an error (at least until another value\nis assigned to it).  Weâll find other uses for del later.\n\n## 5.3.Tuples and SequencesÂ¶\n\nWe saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and\nslicing operations.  They are two examples of sequence data types (see Sequence Types â list, tuple, range ).  Since Python is an evolving language, other sequence data\ntypes may be added.  There is also another standard sequence data type: the tuple .\n\nA tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance:\n\n```python\n>>> t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'\n>>> t[0]\n12345\n>>> t\n(12345, 54321, 'hello!')\n>>> # Tuples may be nested:\n>>> u = t, (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n>>> u\n((12345, 54321, 'hello!'), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5))\n>>> # Tuples are immutable:\n>>> t[0] = 88888\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n>>> # but they can contain mutable objects:\n>>> v = ([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])\n>>> v\n([1, 2, 3], [3, 2, 1])\n```\n\nAs you see, on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so that nested\ntuples are interpreted correctly; they may be input with or without surrounding\nparentheses, although often parentheses are necessary anyway (if the tuple is\npart of a larger expression).  It is not possible to assign to the individual\nitems of a tuple, however it is possible to create tuples which contain mutable\nobjects, such as lists.\n\nThough tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different\nsituations and for different purposes.\nTuples are immutable , and usually contain a heterogeneous sequence of\nelements that are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing\n(or even by attribute in the case of namedtuples ).\nLists are mutable , and their elements are usually homogeneous and are\naccessed by iterating over the list.\n\nA special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the\nsyntax has some extra quirks to accommodate these.  Empty tuples are constructed\nby an empty pair of parentheses; a tuple with one item is constructed by\nfollowing a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to enclose a single value\nin parentheses). Ugly, but effective.  For example:\n\n```python\n>>> empty = ()\n>>> singleton = 'hello',    # <-- note trailing comma\n>>> len(empty)\n0\n>>> len(singleton)\n1\n>>> singleton\n('hello',)\n```\n\nThe statement t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!' is an example of tuple packing :\nthe values 12345 , 54321 and 'hello!' are packed together in a tuple.\nThe reverse operation is also possible:\n\n```python\n>>> x, y, z = t\n```\n\nThis is called, appropriately enough, sequence unpacking and works for any\nsequence on the right-hand side.  Sequence unpacking requires that there are as\nmany variables on the left side of the equals sign as there are elements in the\nsequence.  Note that multiple assignment is really just a combination of tuple\npacking and sequence unpacking.\n\n## 5.4.SetsÂ¶\n\nPython also includes a data type for sets .  A set is\nan unordered collection with no duplicate elements.  Basic uses include\nmembership testing and eliminating duplicate entries.  Set objects also\nsupport mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and\nsymmetric difference.\n\nCurly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets.  Note: to\ncreate an empty set you have to use set() , not {} ; the latter creates an\nempty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss in the next section.\n\nHere is a brief demonstration:\n\n```python\n>>> basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}\n>>> print(basket)                      # show that duplicates have been removed\n{'orange', 'banana', 'pear', 'apple'}\n>>> 'orange' in basket                 # fast membership testing\nTrue\n>>> 'crabgrass' in basket\nFalse\n\n>>> # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words\n>>>\n>>> a = set('abracadabra')\n>>> b = set('alacazam')\n>>> a                                  # unique letters in a\n{'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'}\n>>> a - b                              # letters in a but not in b\n{'r', 'd', 'b'}\n>>> a | b                              # letters in a or b or both\n{'a', 'c', 'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}\n>>> a & b                              # letters in both a and b\n{'a', 'c'}\n>>> a ^ b                              # letters in a or b but not both\n{'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}\n```\n\nSimilarly to list comprehensions , set comprehensions\nare also supported:\n\n```python\n>>> a = {x for x in 'abracadabra' if x not in 'abc'}\n>>> a\n{'r', 'd'}\n```\n\n## 5.5.DictionariesÂ¶\n\nAnother useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see Mapping Types â dict ). Dictionaries are sometimes found in other languages as\nâassociative memoriesâ or âassociative arraysâ.  Unlike sequences, which are\nindexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys , which can be\nany immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys.  Tuples can be used\nas keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains\nany mutable object either directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key.\nYou canât use lists as keys, since lists can be modified in place using index\nassignments, slice assignments, or methods like append() and extend() .\n\nIt is best to think of a dictionary as a set of key: value pairs,\nwith the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of\nbraces creates an empty dictionary: {} . Placing a comma-separated list of\nkey:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the\ndictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.\n\nThe main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and\nextracting the value given the key.  It is also possible to delete a key:value\npair with del . If you store using a key that is already in use, the old\nvalue associated with that key is forgotten.\n\nExtracting a value for a non-existent key by subscripting ( d[key] ) raises a KeyError . To avoid getting this error when trying to access a possibly\nnon-existent key, use the get() method instead, which returns None (or a specified default value) if the key is not in the dictionary.\n\nPerforming list(d) on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys\nused in the dictionary, in insertion order (if you want it sorted, just use sorted(d) instead). To check whether a single key is in the\ndictionary, use the in keyword.\n\nHere is a small example using a dictionary:\n\n```python\n>>> tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139}\n>>> tel['guido'] = 4127\n>>> tel\n{'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127}\n>>> tel['jack']\n4098\n>>> tel['irv']\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nKeyError: 'irv'\n>>> print(tel.get('irv'))\nNone\n>>> del tel['sape']\n>>> tel['irv'] = 4127\n>>> tel\n{'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127, 'irv': 4127}\n>>> list(tel)\n['jack', 'guido', 'irv']\n>>> sorted(tel)\n['guido', 'irv', 'jack']\n>>> 'guido' in tel\nTrue\n>>> 'jack' not in tel\nFalse\n```\n\nThe dict() constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences of\nkey-value pairs:\n\n```python\n>>> dict([('sape', 4139), ('guido', 4127), ('jack', 4098)])\n{'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127, 'jack': 4098}\n```\n\nIn addition, dict comprehensions can be used to create dictionaries from\narbitrary key and value expressions:\n\n```python\n>>> {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)}\n{2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36}\n```\n\nWhen the keys are simple strings, it is sometimes easier to specify pairs using\nkeyword arguments:\n\n```python\n>>> dict(sape=4139, guido=4127, jack=4098)\n{'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127, 'jack': 4098}\n```\n\n## 5.6.Looping TechniquesÂ¶\n\nWhen looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can be\nretrieved at the same time using the items() method.\n\n```python\n>>> knights = {'gallahad': 'the pure', 'robin': 'the brave'}\n>>> for k, v in knights.items():\n...     print(k, v)\n...\ngallahad the pure\nrobin the brave\n```\n\nWhen looping through a sequence, the position index and corresponding value can\nbe retrieved at the same time using the enumerate() function.\n\n```python\n>>> for i, v in enumerate(['tic', 'tac', 'toe']):\n...     print(i, v)\n...\n0 tic\n1 tac\n2 toe\n```\n\nTo loop over two or more sequences at the same time, the entries can be paired\nwith the zip() function.\n\n```python\n>>> questions = ['name', 'quest', 'favorite color']\n>>> answers = ['lancelot', 'the holy grail', 'blue']\n>>> for q, a in zip(questions, answers):\n...     print('What is your {0}?  It is {1}.'.format(q, a))\n...\nWhat is your name?  It is lancelot.\nWhat is your quest?  It is the holy grail.\nWhat is your favorite color?  It is blue.\n```\n\nTo loop over a sequence in reverse, first specify the sequence in a forward\ndirection and then call the reversed() function.\n\n```python\n>>> for i in reversed(range(1, 10, 2)):\n...     print(i)\n...\n9\n7\n5\n3\n1\n```\n\nTo loop over a sequence in sorted order, use the sorted() function which\nreturns a new sorted list while leaving the source unaltered.\n\n```python\n>>> basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana']\n>>> for i in sorted(basket):\n...     print(i)\n...\napple\napple\nbanana\norange\norange\npear\n```\n\nUsing set() on a sequence eliminates duplicate elements. The use of sorted() in combination with set() over a sequence is an idiomatic\nway to loop over unique elements of the sequence in sorted order.\n\n```python\n>>> basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana']\n>>> for f in sorted(set(basket)):\n...     print(f)\n...\napple\nbanana\norange\npear\n```\n\nIt is sometimes tempting to change a list while you are looping over it;\nhowever, it is often simpler and safer to create a new list instead.\n\n```python\n>>> import math\n>>> raw_data = [56.2, float('NaN'), 51.7, 55.3, 52.5, float('NaN'), 47.8]\n>>> filtered_data = []\n>>> for value in raw_data:\n...     if not math.isnan(value):\n...         filtered_data.append(value)\n...\n>>> filtered_data\n[56.2, 51.7, 55.3, 52.5, 47.8]\n```\n\n## 5.7.More on ConditionsÂ¶\n\nThe conditions used in while and if statements can contain any\noperators, not just comparisons.\n\nThe comparison operators in and not in are membership tests that\ndetermine whether a value is in (or not in) a container.  The operators is and is not compare whether two objects are really the same object.  All\ncomparison operators have the same priority, which is lower than that of all\nnumerical operators.\n\nComparisons can be chained.  For example, a < b == c tests whether a is\nless than b and moreover b equals c .\n\nComparisons may be combined using the Boolean operators and and or , and\nthe outcome of a comparison (or of any other Boolean expression) may be negated\nwith not .  These have lower priorities than comparison operators; between\nthem, not has the highest priority and or the lowest, so that A and not B or C is equivalent to (A and (not B)) or C . As always, parentheses\ncan be used to express the desired composition.\n\nThe Boolean operators and and or are so-called short-circuit operators: their arguments are evaluated from left to right, and evaluation\nstops as soon as the outcome is determined.  For example, if A and C are\ntrue but B is false, A and B and C does not evaluate the expression C .  When used as a general value and not as a Boolean, the return value of a\nshort-circuit operator is the last evaluated argument.\n\nIt is possible to assign the result of a comparison or other Boolean expression\nto a variable.  For example,\n\n```python\n>>> string1, string2, string3 = '', 'Trondheim', 'Hammer Dance'\n>>> non_null = string1 or string2 or string3\n>>> non_null\n'Trondheim'\n```\n\nNote that in Python, unlike C, assignment inside expressions must be done\nexplicitly with the walrus operator := .\nThis avoids a common class of problems encountered in C programs: typing = in an expression when == was intended.\n\n## 5.8.Comparing Sequences and Other TypesÂ¶\n\nSequence objects typically may be compared to other objects with the same sequence\ntype. The comparison uses lexicographical ordering: first the first two\nitems are compared, and if they differ this determines the outcome of the\ncomparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on, until\neither sequence is exhausted. If two items to be compared are themselves\nsequences of the same type, the lexicographical comparison is carried out\nrecursively.  If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are\nconsidered equal. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the\nshorter sequence is the smaller (lesser) one.  Lexicographical ordering for\nstrings uses the Unicode code point number to order individual characters.\nSome examples of comparisons between sequences of the same type:\n\n```python\n(1, 2, 3)              < (1, 2, 4)\n[1, 2, 3]              < [1, 2, 4]\n'ABC' < 'C' < 'Pascal' < 'Python'\n(1, 2, 3, 4)           < (1, 2, 4)\n(1, 2)                 < (1, 2, -1)\n(1, 2, 3)             == (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)\n(1, 2, ('aa', 'ab'))   < (1, 2, ('abc', 'a'), 4)\n```\n\nNote that comparing objects of different types with < or > is legal\nprovided that the objects have appropriate comparison methods.  For example,\nmixed numeric types are compared according to their numeric value, so 0 equals\n0.0, etc.  Otherwise, rather than providing an arbitrary ordering, the\ninterpreter will raise a TypeError exception.\n\nFootnotes",
