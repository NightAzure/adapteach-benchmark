  "content": "Buy this book at Amazon.com Chapter 12  Tuples This chapter presents one more built-in type, the tuple, and then\nshows how lists, dictionaries, and tuples work together.\nI also present a useful feature for variable-length argument lists,\nthe gather and scatter operators. One note: there is no consensus on how to pronounce “tuple”.\nSome people say “tuh-ple”, which rhymes with “supple”. But\nin the context of programming, most people say “too-ple”, which\nrhymes with “quadruple”. 12.1  Tuples are immutable A tuple is a sequence of values. The values can be any type, and\nthey are indexed by integers, so in that respect tuples are a lot\nlike lists. The important difference is that tuples are immutable. Syntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values: >>> t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' Although it is not necessary, it is common to enclose tuples in\nparentheses: >>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e') To create a tuple with a single element, you have to include a final\ncomma: >>> t1 = 'a',\n>>> type(t1)\n<class 'tuple'> A value in parentheses is not a tuple: >>> t2 = ('a')\n>>> type(t2)\n<class 'str'> Another way to create a tuple is the built-in function tuple .\nWith no argument, it creates an empty tuple: >>> t = tuple()\n>>> t\n() If the argument is a sequence (string, list or tuple), the result\nis a tuple with the elements of the sequence: >>> t = tuple('lupins')\n>>> t\n('l', 'u', 'p', 'i', 'n', 's') Because tuple is the name of a built-in function, you should\navoid using it as a variable name. Most list operators also work on tuples. The bracket operator\nindexes an element: >>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')\n>>> t[0]\n'a' And the slice operator selects a range of elements. >>> t[1:3]\n('b', 'c') But if you try to modify one of the elements of the tuple, you get\nan error: >>> t[0] = 'A'\nTypeError: object doesn't support item assignment Because tuples are immutable, you can’t modify the elements. But you\ncan replace one tuple with another: >>> t = ('A',) + t[1:]\n>>> t\n('A', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e') This statement makes a new tuple and then makes t refer to it. The relational operators work with tuples and other sequences;\nPython starts by comparing the first element from each\nsequence. If they are equal, it goes on to the next elements,\nand so on, until it finds elements that differ. Subsequent\nelements are not considered (even if they are really big). >>> (0, 1, 2) < (0, 3, 4)\nTrue\n>>> (0, 1, 2000000) < (0, 3, 4)\nTrue 12.2  Tuple assignment It is often useful to swap the values of two variables.\nWith conventional assignments, you have to use a temporary\nvariable. For example, to swap a and b : >>> temp = a\n>>> a = b\n>>> b = temp This solution is cumbersome; tuple assignment is more elegant: >>> a, b = b, a The left side is a tuple of variables; the right side is a tuple of\nexpressions. Each value is assigned to its respective variable. \nAll the expressions on the right side are evaluated before any\nof the assignments. The number of variables on the left and the number of\nvalues on the right have to be the same: >>> a, b = 1, 2, 3\nValueError: too many values to unpack More generally, the right side can be any kind of sequence\n(string, list or tuple). For example, to split an email address\ninto a user name and a domain, you could write: >>> addr = 'monty@python.org'\n>>> uname, domain = addr.split('@') The return value from split is a list with two elements;\nthe first element is assigned to uname , the second to domain . >>> uname\n'monty'\n>>> domain\n'python.org' 12.3  Tuples as return values Strictly speaking, a function can only return one value, but\nif the value is a tuple, the effect is the same as returning\nmultiple values. For example, if you want to divide two integers\nand compute the quotient and remainder, it is inefficient to\ncompute x//y and then x%y . It is better to compute\nthem both at the same time. The built-in function divmod takes two arguments and\nreturns a tuple of two values, the quotient and remainder.\nYou can store the result as a tuple: >>> t = divmod(7, 3)\n>>> t\n(2, 1) Or use tuple assignment to store the elements separately: >>> quot, rem = divmod(7, 3)\n>>> quot\n2\n>>> rem\n1 Here is an example of a function that returns a tuple: def min_max(t):\n    return min(t), max(t) max and min are built-in functions that find\nthe largest and smallest elements of a sequence. min_max computes both and returns a tuple of two values. 12.4  Variable-length argument tuples Functions can take a variable number of arguments. A parameter\nname that begins with * gathers arguments into\na tuple. For example, printall takes any number of arguments and prints them: def printall(*args):\n    print(args) The gather parameter can have any name you like, but args is\nconventional. Here’s how the function works: >>> printall(1, 2.0, '3')\n(1, 2.0, '3') The complement of gather is scatter . If you have a\nsequence of values and you want to pass it to a function\nas multiple arguments, you can use the * operator.\nFor example, divmod takes exactly two arguments; it\ndoesn’t work with a tuple: >>> t = (7, 3)\n>>> divmod(t)\nTypeError: divmod expected 2 arguments, got 1 But if you scatter the tuple, it works: >>> divmod(*t)\n(2, 1) Many of the built-in functions use\nvariable-length argument tuples. For example, max and min can take any number of arguments: >>> max(1, 2, 3)\n3 But sum does not. >>> sum(1, 2, 3)\nTypeError: sum expected at most 2 arguments, got 3 As an exercise, write a function called sum_all that takes any number\nof arguments and returns their sum. 12.5  Lists and tuples zip is a built-in function that takes two or more sequences and\ninterleaves them. The name of the function refers to\na zipper, which interleaves two rows of teeth. This example zips a string and a list: >>> s = 'abc'\n>>> t = [0, 1, 2]\n>>> zip(s, t)\n<zip object at 0x7f7d0a9e7c48> The result is a zip object that knows how to iterate through\nthe pairs. The most common use of zip is in a for loop: >>> for pair in zip(s, t):\n...     print(pair)\n...\n('a', 0)\n('b', 1)\n('c', 2) A zip object is a kind of iterator , which is any object\nthat iterates through a sequence. Iterators are similar to lists in some\nways, but unlike lists, you can’t use an index to select an element from\nan iterator. If you want to use list operators and methods, you can\nuse a zip object to make a list: >>> list(zip(s, t))\n[('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 2)] The result is a list of tuples; in this example, each tuple contains\na character from the string and the corresponding element from\nthe list. If the sequences are not the same length, the result has the\nlength of the shorter one. >>> list(zip('Anne', 'Elk'))\n[('A', 'E'), ('n', 'l'), ('n', 'k')] You can use tuple assignment in a for loop to traverse a list of\ntuples: t = [('a', 0), ('b', 1), ('c', 2)]\nfor letter, number in t:\n    print(number, letter) Each time through the loop, Python selects the next tuple in\nthe list and assigns the elements to letter and number . The output of this loop is: 0 a\n1 b\n2 c If you combine zip , for and tuple assignment, you get a\nuseful idiom for traversing two (or more) sequences at the same\ntime. For example, has_match takes two sequences, t1 and t2 , and returns True if there is an index i such that t1[i] == t2[i] : def has_match(t1, t2):\n    for x, y in zip(t1, t2):\n        if x == y:\n            return True\n    return False If you need to traverse the elements of a sequence and their\nindices, you can use the built-in function enumerate : for index, element in enumerate('abc'):\n    print(index, element) The result from enumerate is an enumerate object, which\niterates a sequence of pairs; each pair contains an index (starting\nfrom 0) and an element from the given sequence.\nIn this example, the output is 0 a\n1 b\n2 c Again. 12.6  Dictionaries and tuples Dictionaries have a method called items that returns a sequence of\ntuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair. >>> d = {'a':0, 'b':1, 'c':2}\n>>> t = d.items()\n>>> t\ndict_items([('c', 2), ('a', 0), ('b', 1)]) The result is a dict_items object, which is an iterator that\niterates the key-value pairs. You can use it in a for loop\nlike this: >>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print(key, value)\n...\nc 2\na 0\nb 1 As you should expect from a dictionary, the items are in no\nparticular order. Going in the other direction, you can use a list of tuples to\ninitialize a new dictionary: >>> t = [('a', 0), ('c', 2), ('b', 1)]\n>>> d = dict(t)\n>>> d\n{'a': 0, 'c': 2, 'b': 1} Combining dict with zip yields a concise way\nto create a dictionary: >>> d = dict(zip('abc', range(3)))\n>>> d\n{'a': 0, 'c': 2, 'b': 1} The dictionary method update also takes a list of tuples\nand adds them, as key-value pairs, to an existing dictionary. It is common to use tuples as keys in dictionaries (primarily because\nyou can’t use lists). For example, a telephone directory might map\nfrom last-name, first-name pairs to telephone numbers. Assuming\nthat we have defined last , first and number , we\ncould write: directory[last, first] = number The expression in brackets is a tuple. We could use tuple\nassignment to traverse this dictionary. for last, first in directory:\n    print(first, last, directory[last,first]) This loop traverses the keys in directory , which are tuples. It\nassigns the elements of each tuple to last and first , then\nprints the name and corresponding telephone number. There are two ways to represent tuples in a state diagram. The more\ndetailed version shows the indices and elements just as they appear in\na list. For example, the tuple ('Cleese', 'John') would appear\nas in Figure 12.1 . Figure 12.1: State diagram. But in a larger diagram you might want to leave out the\ndetails. For example, a diagram of the telephone directory might\nappear as in Figure 12.2 . Figure 12.2: State diagram. Here the tuples are shown using Python syntax as a graphical\nshorthand. The telephone number in the diagram is the complaints line\nfor the BBC, so please don’t call it. 12.7  Sequences of sequences I have focused on lists of tuples, but almost all of the examples in\nthis chapter also work with lists of lists, tuples of tuples, and\ntuples of lists. To avoid enumerating the possible combinations, it\nis sometimes easier to talk about sequences of sequences. In many contexts, the different kinds of sequences (strings, lists and\ntuples) can be used interchangeably. So how should you choose one\nover the others? To start with the obvious, strings are more limited than other\nsequences because the elements have to be characters. They are\nalso immutable. If you need the ability to change the characters\nin a string (as opposed to creating a new string), you might\nwant to use a list of characters instead. Lists are more common than tuples, mostly because they are mutable.\nBut there are a few cases where you might prefer tuples: In some contexts, like a return statement, it is\nsyntactically simpler to create a tuple than a list. If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you\nhave to use an immutable type like a tuple or string. If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function,\nusing tuples reduces the potential for unexpected behavior\ndue to aliasing. Because tuples are immutable, they don’t provide methods like sort and reverse , which modify existing lists. But Python\nprovides the built-in function sorted , which takes any sequence\nand returns a new list with the same elements in sorted order, and reversed , which takes a sequence and returns an iterator that\ntraverses the list in reverse order. 12.8  Debugging Lists, dictionaries and tuples are examples of data\nstructures ; in this chapter we are starting to see compound data\nstructures, like lists of tuples, or dictionaries that contain tuples\nas keys and lists as values. Compound data structures are useful, but\nthey are prone to what I call shape errors ; that is, errors\ncaused when a data structure has the wrong type, size, or structure.\nFor example, if you are expecting a list with one integer and I\ngive you a plain old integer (not in a list), it won’t work. To help debug these kinds of errors, I have written a module\ncalled structshape that provides a function, also called structshape , that takes any kind of data structure as\nan argument and returns a string that summarizes its shape.\nYou can download it from https://thinkpython.com/code/structshape.py Here’s the result for a simple list: >>> from structshape import structshape\n>>> t = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> structshape(t)\n'list of 3 int' A fancier program might write “list of 3 int s ”, but it\nwas easier not to deal with plurals. Here’s a list of lists: >>> t2 = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]\n>>> structshape(t2)\n'list of 3 list of 2 int' If the elements of the list are not the same type, structshape groups them, in order, by type: >>> t3 = [1, 2, 3, 4.0, '5', '6', [7], [8], 9]\n>>> structshape(t3)\n'list of (3 int, float, 2 str, 2 list of int, int)' Here’s a list of tuples: >>> s = 'abc'\n>>> lt = list(zip(t, s))\n>>> structshape(lt)\n'list of 3 tuple of (int, str)' And here’s a dictionary with 3 items that map integers to strings. >>> d = dict(lt) \n>>> structshape(d)\n'dict of 3 int->str' If you are having trouble keeping track of your data structures, structshape can help. 12.9  Glossary tuple: An immutable sequence of elements. tuple assignment: An assignment with a sequence on the\nright side and a tuple of variables on the left. The right\nside is evaluated and then its elements are assigned to the\nvariables on the left. gather: An operation that collects multiple arguments into a tuple. scatter: An operation that makes a sequence behave like multiple arguments. zip object: The result of calling a built-in function zip ;\nan object that iterates through a sequence of tuples. iterator: An object that can iterate through a sequence, but\nwhich does not provide list operators and methods. data structure: A collection of related values, often\norganized in lists, dictionaries, tuples, etc. shape error: An error caused because a value has the\nwrong shape; that is, the wrong type or size. 12.10  Exercises Exercise 1 Write a function called most_frequent that takes a string and\nprints the letters in decreasing order of frequency. Find text\nsamples from several different languages and see how letter frequency\nvaries between languages. Compare your results with the tables at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequencies . Solution: https://thinkpython.com/code/most_frequent.py . Exercise 2 More anagrams! Write a program\nthat reads a word list from a file (see Section 9.1 ) and\nprints all the sets of words that are anagrams. Here is an example of what the output might look like: ['deltas', 'desalt', 'lasted', 'salted', 'slated', 'staled']\n['retainers', 'ternaries']\n['generating', 'greatening']\n['resmelts', 'smelters', 'termless'] Hint: you might want to build a dictionary that maps from a\ncollection of letters to a list of words that can be spelled with those\nletters. The question is, how can you represent the collection of\nletters in a way that can be used as a key? Modify the previous program so that it prints the longest list\nof anagrams first, followed by the second longest, and so on. In Scrabble a “bingo” is when you play all seven tiles in\nyour rack, along with a letter on the board, to form an eight-letter\nword. What collection of 8 letters forms the most possible bingos? Solution: https://thinkpython.com/code/anagram_sets.py . Exercise 3 Two words form a “metathesis pair” if you can transform one into the\nother by swapping two letters; for example, “converse” and\n“conserve”. Write a program that finds all of the metathesis pairs\nin the dictionary. Hint: don’t test all pairs of words, and don’t\ntest all possible swaps. Solution: https://thinkpython.com/code/metathesis.py . Credit: This\nexercise is inspired by an example at http://puzzlers.org . Exercise 4 Here’s another Car Talk Puzzler\n( http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers ): What is the longest English word, that remains a valid English word,\nas you remove its letters one at a time? Now, letters can be removed from either end, or the middle, but you\ncan’t rearrange any of the letters. Every time you drop a letter, you\nwind up with another English word. If you do that, you’re eventually\ngoing to wind up with one letter and that too is going to be an\nEnglish word—one that’s found in the dictionary. I want to know\nwhat’s the longest word and how many letters does it\nhave? I’m going to give you a little modest example: Sprite. Ok? You start\noff with sprite, you take a letter off, one from the interior of the\nword, take the r away, and we’re left with the word spite, then we\ntake the e off the end, we’re left with spit, we take the s off, we’re\nleft with pit, it, and I. Write a program to find all words that can be reduced in this way,\nand then find the longest one. This exercise is a little more challenging than most, so here are\nsome suggestions: You might want to write a function that takes a word and\ncomputes a list of all the words that can be formed by removing one\nletter. These are the “children” of the word. Recursively, a word is reducible if any of its children\nare reducible. As a base case, you can consider the empty\nstring reducible. The wordlist I provided, words.txt , doesn’t\ncontain single letter words. So you might want to add\n“I”, “a”, and the empty string. To improve the performance of your program, you might want\nto memoize the words that are known to be reducible. Solution: https://thinkpython.com/code/reducible.py .
