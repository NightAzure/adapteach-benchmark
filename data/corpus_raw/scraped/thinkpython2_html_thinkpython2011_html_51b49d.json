In a string, the\nvalues are characters; in a list, they can be any type. The values in\na list are called elements or sometimes items . There are several ways to create a new list; the simplest is to\nenclose the elements in square brackets ( [ and ] ): [10, 20, 30, 40]\n['crunchy frog', 'ram bladder', 'lark vomit'] The first example is a list of four integers. The second is a list of\nthree strings. The elements of a list don’t have to be the same type.\nThe following list contains a string, a float, an integer, and\n(lo!) another list: ['spam', 2.0, 5, [10, 20]] A list within another list is nested . A list that contains no elements is\ncalled an empty list; you can create one with empty\nbrackets, [] . As you might expect, you can assign list values to variables: >>> cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']\n>>> numbers = [42, 123]\n>>> empty = []\n>>> print(cheeses, numbers, empty)\n['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda'] [42, 123] [] 10.2  Lists are mutable The syntax for accessing the elements of a list is the same as for\naccessing the characters of a string—the bracket operator. The\nexpression inside the brackets specifies the index. Remember that the\nindices start at 0: >>> cheeses[0]\n'Cheddar' Unlike strings, lists are mutable. When the bracket operator appears\non the left side of an assignment, it identifies the element of the\nlist that will be assigned. >>> numbers = [42, 123]\n>>> numbers[1] = 5\n>>> numbers\n[42, 5] The one-eth element of numbers , which\nused to be 123, is now 5. Figure 10.1 shows \nthe state diagram for cheeses , numbers and empty . Figure 10.1: State diagram. Lists are represented by boxes with the word “list” outside\nand the elements of the list inside. cheeses refers to\na list with three elements indexed 0, 1 and 2. numbers contains two elements; the diagram shows that the\nvalue of the second element has been reassigned from 123 to 5. empty refers to a list with no elements. List indices work the same way as string indices: Any integer expression can be used as an index. If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you\nget an IndexError . If an index has a negative value, it counts backward from the\nend of the list. The in operator also works on lists. >>> cheeses = ['Cheddar', 'Edam', 'Gouda']\n>>> 'Edam' in cheeses\nTrue\n>>> 'Brie' in cheeses\nFalse 10.3  Traversing a list The most common way to traverse the elements of a list is\nwith a for loop. The syntax is the same as for strings: for cheese in cheeses:\n    print(cheese) This works well if you only need to read the elements of the\nlist. But if you want to write or update the elements, you\nneed the indices. A common way to do that is to combine\nthe built-in functions range and len : for i in range(len(numbers)):\n    numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2 This loop traverses the list and updates each element. len returns the number of elements in the list. range returns\na list of indices from 0 to n −1, where n is the length of\nthe list. Each time through the loop i gets the index\nof the next element. The assignment statement in the body uses i to read the old value of the element and to assign the\nnew value. A for loop over an empty list never runs the body: for x in []:\n    print('This never happens.') Although a list can contain another list, the nested\nlist still counts as a single element. The length of this list is\nfour: ['spam', 1, ['Brie', 'Roquefort', 'Pol le Veq'], [1, 2, 3]] 10.4  List operations The + operator concatenates lists: >>> a = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> b = [4, 5, 6]\n>>> c = a + b\n>>> c\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] The * operator repeats a list a given number of times: >>> [0] * 4\n[0, 0, 0, 0]\n>>> [1, 2, 3] * 3\n[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3] The first example repeats [0] four times. The second example\nrepeats the list [1, 2, 3] three times. 10.5  List slices The slice operator also works on lists: >>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n>>> t[1:3]\n['b', 'c']\n>>> t[:4]\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n>>> t[3:]\n['d', 'e', 'f'] If you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning.\nIf you omit the second, the slice goes to the end. So if you\nomit both, the slice is a copy of the whole list. >>> t[:]\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'] Since lists are mutable, it is often useful to make a copy\nbefore performing operations that modify lists. A slice operator on the left side of an assignment\ncan update multiple elements: >>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n>>> t[1:3] = ['x', 'y']\n>>> t\n['a', 'x', 'y', 'd', 'e', 'f'] 10.6  List methods Python provides methods that operate on lists. For example, append adds a new element to the end of a list: >>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> t.append('d')\n>>> t\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] extend takes a list as an argument and appends all of\nthe elements: >>> t1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> t2 = ['d', 'e']\n>>> t1.extend(t2)\n>>> t1\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] This example leaves t2 unmodified. sort arranges the elements of the list from low to high: >>> t = ['d', 'c', 'e', 'b', 'a']\n>>> t.sort()\n>>> t\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'] Most list methods are void; they modify the list and return None .\nIf you accidentally write t = t.sort() , you will be disappointed\nwith the result. 10.7  Map, filter and reduce To add up all the numbers in a list, you can use a loop like this: def add_all(t):\n    total = 0\n    for x in t:\n        total += x\n    return total total is initialized to 0. Each time through the loop, x gets one element from the list. The += operator\nprovides a short way to update a variable. This augmented assignment statement , total += x is equivalent to total = total + x As the loop runs, total accumulates the sum of the\nelements; a variable used this way is sometimes called an accumulator . Adding up the elements of a list is such a common operation\nthat Python provides it as a built-in function, sum : >>> t = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> sum(t)\n6 An operation like this that combines a sequence of elements into\na single value is sometimes called reduce . Sometimes you want to traverse one list while building\nanother. For example, the following function takes a list of strings\nand returns a new list that contains capitalized strings: def capitalize_all(t):\n    res = []\n    for s in t:\n        res.append(s.capitalize())\n    return res res is initialized with an empty list; each time through\nthe loop, we append the next element. So res is another\nkind of accumulator. An operation like capitalize_all is sometimes called a map because it “maps” a function (in this case the method capitalize ) onto each of the elements in a sequence. Another common operation is to select some of the elements from\na list and return a sublist. For example, the following\nfunction takes a list of strings and returns a list that contains\nonly the uppercase strings: def only_upper(t):\n    res = []\n    for s in t:\n        if s.isupper():\n            res.append(s)\n    return res isupper is a string method that returns True if\nthe string contains only upper case letters. An operation like only_upper is called a filter because\nit selects some of the elements and filters out the others. Most common list operations can be expressed as a combination\nof map, filter and reduce. 10.8  Deleting elements There are several ways to delete elements from a list. If you\nknow the index of the element you want, you can use pop : >>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> x = t.pop(1)\n>>> t\n['a', 'c']\n>>> x\n'b' pop modifies the list and returns the element that was removed.\nIf you don’t provide an index, it deletes and returns the\nlast element. If you don’t need the removed value, you can use the del operator: >>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> del t[1]\n>>> t\n['a', 'c'] If you know the element you want to remove (but not the index), you\ncan use remove : >>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> t.remove('b')\n>>> t\n['a', 'c'] The return value from remove is None . To remove more than one element, you can use del with\na slice index: >>> t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']\n>>> del t[1:5]\n>>> t\n['a', 'f'] As usual, the slice selects all the elements up to but not\nincluding the second index. 10.9  Lists and strings A string is a sequence of characters and a list is a sequence\nof values, but a list of characters is not the same as a\nstring. To convert from a string to a list of characters,\nyou can use list : >>> s = 'spam'\n>>> t = list(s)\n>>> t\n['s', 'p', 'a', 'm'] Because list is the name of a built-in function, you should\navoid using it as a variable name. I also avoid l because\nit looks too much like 1 . So that’s why I use t . The list function breaks a string into individual letters. If\nyou want to break a string into words, you can use the split method: >>> s = 'pining for the fjords'\n>>> t = s.split()\n>>> t\n['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords'] An optional argument called a delimiter specifies which\ncharacters to use as word boundaries.\nThe following example\nuses a hyphen as a delimiter: >>> s = 'spam-spam-spam'\n>>> delimiter = '-'\n>>> t = s.split(delimiter)\n>>> t\n['spam', 'spam', 'spam'] join is the inverse of split . It\ntakes a list of strings and\nconcatenates the elements. join is a string method,\nso you have to invoke it on the delimiter and pass the\nlist as a parameter: >>> t = ['pining', 'for', 'the', 'fjords']\n>>> delimiter = ' '\n>>> s = delimiter.join(t)\n>>> s\n'pining for the fjords' In this case the delimiter is a space character, so join puts a space between words. To concatenate\nstrings without spaces, you can use the empty string, '' , as a delimiter. 10.10  Objects and values If we run these assignment statements: a = 'banana'\nb = 'banana' We know that a and b both refer to a\nstring, but we don’t\nknow whether they refer to the same string.\nThere are two possible states, shown in Figure 10.2 . Figure 10.2: State diagram. In one case, a and b refer to two different objects that\nhave the same value. In the second case, they refer to the same\nobject. To check whether two variables refer to the same object, you can\nuse the is operator. >>> a = 'banana'\n>>> b = 'banana'\n>>> a is b\nTrue In this example, Python only created one string object, and both a and b refer to it. But when you create two lists, you get\ntwo objects: >>> a = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> b = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> a is b\nFalse So the state diagram looks like Figure 10.3 . Figure 10.3: State diagram. In this case we would say that the two lists are equivalent ,\nbecause they have the same elements, but not identical , because\nthey are not the same object. If two objects are identical, they are\nalso equivalent, but if they are equivalent, they are not necessarily\nidentical. Until now, we have been using “object” and “value”\ninterchangeably, but it is more precise to say that an object has a\nvalue. If you evaluate [1, 2, 3] , you get a list\nobject whose value is a sequence of integers. If another\nlist has the same elements, we say it has the same value, but\nit is not the same object. 10.11  Aliasing If a refers to an object and you assign b = a ,\nthen both variables refer to the same object: >>> a = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> b = a\n>>> b is a\nTrue The state diagram looks like Figure 10.4 . Figure 10.4: State diagram. The association of a variable with an object is called a reference . In this example, there are two references to the same\nobject. An object with more than one reference has more\nthan one name, so we say that the object is aliased . If the aliased object is mutable, changes made with one alias affect\nthe other: >>> b[0] = 42\n>>> a\n[42, 2, 3] Although this behavior can be useful, it is error-prone. In general,\nit is safer to avoid aliasing when you are working with mutable\nobjects. For immutable objects like strings, aliasing is not as much of a\nproblem. In this example: a = 'banana'\nb = 'banana' It almost never makes a difference whether a and b refer\nto the same string or not. 10.12  List arguments When you pass a list to a function, the function gets a reference to\nthe list. If the function modifies the list, the caller sees\nthe change. For example, delete_head removes the first element\nfrom a list: def delete_head(t):\n    del t[0] Here’s how it is used: >>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> delete_head(letters)\n>>> letters\n['b', 'c'] The parameter t and the variable letters are\naliases for the same object. The stack diagram looks like\nFigure 10.5 . Figure 10.5: Stack diagram. Since the list is shared by two frames, I drew\nit between them. It is important to distinguish between operations that\nmodify lists and operations that create new lists. For\nexample, the append method modifies a list, but the + operator creates a new list. Here’s an example using append : >>> t1 = [1, 2]\n>>> t2 = t1.append(3)\n>>> t1\n[1, 2, 3]\n>>> t2\nNone The return value from append is None . Here’s an example using the + operator: >>> t3 = t1 + [4]\n>>> t1\n[1, 2, 3]\n>>> t3\n[1, 2, 3, 4] The result of the operator is a new list, and the original list is\nunchanged. This difference is important when you write functions that\nare supposed to modify lists. For example, this function does not delete the head of a list: def bad_delete_head(t):\n    t = t[1:]              # WRONG! The slice operator creates a new list and the assignment\nmakes t refer to it, but that doesn’t affect the caller. >>> t4 = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> bad_delete_head(t4)\n>>> t4\n[1, 2, 3] At the beginning of bad_delete_head , t and t4 refer to the same list. At the end, t refers to a new list,\nbut t4 still refers to the original, unmodified list. An alternative is to write a function that creates and\nreturns a new list. For\nexample, tail returns all but the first\nelement of a list: def tail(t):\n    return t[1:] This function leaves the original list unmodified.\nHere’s how it is used: >>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> rest = tail(letters)\n>>> rest\n['b', 'c'] 10.13  Debugging Careless use of lists (and other mutable objects)\ncan lead to long hours of debugging. Here are some common\npitfalls and ways to avoid them: Most list methods modify the argument and\nreturn None . This is the opposite of the string methods,\nwhich return a new string and leave the original alone. If you are used to writing string code like this: word = word.strip() It is tempting to write list code like this: t = t.sort()           # WRONG! Because sort returns None , the\nnext operation you perform with t is likely to fail. Before using list methods and operators, you should read the\ndocumentation carefully and then test them in interactive mode. Pick an idiom and stick with it. Part of the problem with lists is that there are too many\nways to do things. For example, to remove an element from\na list, you can use pop , remove , del ,\nor even a slice assignment. To add an element, you can use the append method or\nthe + operator. Assuming that t is a list and x is a list element, these are correct: t.append(x)\nt = t + [x]\nt += [x] And these are wrong: t.append([x])          # WRONG!\nt = t.append(x)        # WRONG!\nt + [x]                # WRONG!\nt = t + x              # WRONG! Try out each of these examples in interactive mode to make sure\nyou understand what they do. Notice that only the last\none causes a runtime error; the other three are legal, but they\ndo the wrong thing. Make copies to avoid aliasing. If you want to use a method like sort that modifies\nthe argument, but you need to keep the original list as\nwell, you can make a copy. >>> t = [3, 1, 2]\n>>> t2 = t[:]\n>>> t2.sort()\n>>> t\n[3, 1, 2]\n>>> t2\n[1, 2, 3] In this example you could also use the built-in function sorted ,\nwhich returns a new, sorted list and leaves the original alone. >>> t2 = sorted(t)\n>>> t\n[3, 1, 2]\n>>> t2\n[1, 2, 3] 10.14  Glossary list: A sequence of values. element: One of the values in a list (or other sequence),\nalso called items. nested list: A list that is an element of another list. accumulator: A variable used in a loop to add up or\naccumulate a result. augmented assignment: A statement that updates the value\nof a variable using an operator like += . reduce: A processing pattern that traverses a sequence \nand accumulates the elements into a single result. map: A processing pattern that traverses a sequence and\nperforms an operation on each element. filter: A processing pattern that traverses a list and\nselects the elements that satisfy some criterion. object: Something a variable can refer to.

Exercise 1 Write a function called nested_sum that takes a list of lists\nof integers and adds up the elements from all of the nested lists.\nFor example: >>> t = [[1, 2], [3], [4, 5, 6]]\n>>> nested_sum(t)\n21 Exercise 2 Write a function called cumsum that takes a list of numbers and\nreturns the cumulative sum; that is, a new list where the i th\nelement is the sum of the first i +1 elements from the original list.\nFor example: >>> t = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> cumsum(t)\n[1, 3, 6] Exercise 3 Write a function called middle that takes a list and\nreturns a new list that contains all but the first and last\nelements. For example: >>> t = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n>>> middle(t)\n[2, 3] Exercise 4 Write a function called chop that takes a list, modifies it\nby removing the first and last elements, and returns None .\nFor example: >>> t = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n>>> chop(t)\n>>> t\n[2, 3] Exercise 5 Write a function called is_sorted that takes a list as a\nparameter and returns True if the list is sorted in ascending\norder and False otherwise. For example: >>> is_sorted([1, 2, 2])\nTrue\n>>> is_sorted(['b', 'a'])\nFalse Exercise 6 Two words are anagrams if you can rearrange the letters from one\nto spell the other. Write a function called is_anagram that takes two strings and returns True if they are anagrams. Exercise 7 Write a function called has_duplicates that takes\na list and returns True if there is any element that\nappears more than once. It should not modify the original\nlist. Exercise 8 This exercise pertains to the so-called Birthday Paradox, which you\ncan read about at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_paradox . If there are 23 students in your class, what are the chances\nthat two of them have the same birthday? You can estimate this\nprobability by generating random samples of 23 birthdays\nand checking for matches. Hint: you can generate random birthdays\nwith the randint function in the random module. You can download my\nsolution from https://thinkpython.com/code/birthday.py . Exercise 9 Write a function that reads the file words.txt and builds\na list with one element per word. Write two versions of\nthis function, one using the append method and the\nother using the idiom t = t + [x] . Which one takes\nlonger to run? Why? Solution: https://thinkpython.com/code/wordlist.py . Exercise 10 To check whether a word is in the word list, you could use\nthe in operator, but it would be slow because it searches\nthrough the words in order. Because the words are in alphabetical order, we can speed things up\nwith a bisection search (also known as binary search), which is\nsimilar to what you do when you look a word up in the dictionary (the book, not the data structure). You\nstart in the middle and check to see whether the word you are looking\nfor comes before the word in the middle of the list. If so, you\nsearch the first half of the list the same way. Otherwise you search\nthe second half. Either way, you cut the remaining search space in half. If the\nword list has 113,809 words, it will take about 17 steps to\nfind the word or conclude that it’s not there. Write a function called in_bisect that takes a sorted list\nand a target value and returns True if the word is\nin the list and False if it’s not. Or you could read the documentation of the bisect module\nand use that! Solution: https://thinkpython.com/code/inlist.py . Exercise 11 Two words are a “reverse pair” if each is the reverse of the\nother. Write a program that finds all the reverse pairs in the\nword list. Solution: https://thinkpython.com/code/reverse_pair.py . Exercise 12 Two words “interlock” if taking alternating letters from each forms\na new word. For example, “shoe” and “cold”\ninterlock to form “schooled”.\nSolution: https://thinkpython.com/code/interlock.py .\nCredit: This exercise is inspired by an example at http://puzzlers.org . Write a program that finds all pairs of words that interlock.\nHint: don’t enumerate all pairs! Can you find any words that are three-way interlocked; that is,\nevery third letter forms a word, starting from the first, second or\nthird?
