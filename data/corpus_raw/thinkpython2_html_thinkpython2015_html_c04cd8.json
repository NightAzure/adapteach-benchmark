If you run the program\nagain, it starts with a clean slate. Other programs are persistent : they run for a long time\n(or all the time); they keep at least some of their data\nin permanent storage (a hard drive, for example); and\nif they shut down and restart, they pick up where they left off. Examples of persistent programs are operating systems, which\nrun pretty much whenever a computer is on, and web servers,\nwhich run all the time, waiting for requests to come in on\nthe network. One of the simplest ways for programs to maintain their data\nis by reading and writing text files. We have already seen\nprograms that read text files; in this chapter we will see programs\nthat write them. An alternative is to store the state of the program in a database.\nIn this chapter I will present a simple database and a module, pickle , that makes it easy to store program data. 14.2  Reading and writing A text file is a sequence of characters stored on a permanent\nmedium like a hard drive, flash memory, or CD-ROM. We saw how\nto open and read a file in Section 9.1 . To write a file, you have to open it with mode 'w' as a second\nparameter: >>> fout = open('output.txt', 'w') If the file already exists, opening it in write mode clears out\nthe old data and starts fresh, so be careful!\nIf the file doesn’t exist, a new one is created. open returns a file object that provides methods for working\nwith the file.\nThe write method puts data into the file. >>> line1 = \"This here's the wattle,\\n\"\n>>> fout.write(line1)\n24 The return value is the number of characters that were written.\nThe file object keeps track of where it is, so if\nyou call write again, it adds the new data to the end of\nthe file. >>> line2 = \"the emblem of our land.\\n\"\n>>> fout.write(line2)\n24 When you are done writing, you should close the file. >>> fout.close() If you don’t close the file, it gets closed for you when the\nprogram ends. 14.3  Format operator The argument of write has to be a string, so if we want\nto put other values in a file, we have to convert them to\nstrings. The easiest way to do that is with str : >>> x = 52\n>>> fout.write(str(x)) An alternative is to use the format operator , % . When\napplied to integers, % is the modulus operator. But\nwhen the first operand is a string, % is the format operator. The first operand is the format string , which contains\none or more format sequences , which\nspecify how\nthe second operand is formatted. The result is a string. For example, the format sequence '%d' means that\nthe second operand should be formatted as a decimal\ninteger: >>> camels = 42\n>>> '%d' % camels\n'42' The result is the string '42' , which is not to be confused\nwith the integer value 42 . A format sequence can appear anywhere in the string,\nso you can embed a value in a sentence: >>> 'I have spotted %d camels.' % camels\n'I have spotted 42 camels.' If there is more than one format sequence in the string,\nthe second argument has to be a tuple. Each format sequence is\nmatched with an element of the tuple, in order. The following example uses '%d' to format an integer, '%g' to format a floating-point number, and '%s' to format a string: >>> 'In %d years I have spotted %g %s.' % (3, 0.1, 'camels')\n'In 3 years I have spotted 0.1 camels.' The number of elements in the tuple has to match the number\nof format sequences in the string. Also, the types of the\nelements have to match the format sequences: >>> '%d %d %d' % (1, 2)\nTypeError: not enough arguments for format string\n>>> '%d' % 'dollars'\nTypeError: %d format: a number is required, not str In the first example, there aren’t enough elements; in the\nsecond, the element is the wrong type. For more information on the format operator, see https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#printf-style-string-formatting . A more powerful alternative is the string\nformat method, which you can read about at https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format . 14.4  Filenames and paths Files are organized into directories (also called “folders”).\nEvery running program has a “current directory”, which is the\ndefault directory for most operations. \nFor example, when you open a file for reading, Python looks for it in the\ncurrent directory. The os module provides functions for working with files and\ndirectories (“os” stands for “operating system”). os.getcwd returns the name of the current directory: >>> import os\n>>> cwd = os.getcwd()\n>>> cwd\n'/home/dinsdale' cwd stands for “current working directory”. The result in\nthis example is /home/dinsdale , which is the home directory of a\nuser named dinsdale . A string like '/home/dinsdale' that identifies a file or\ndirectory is called a path . A simple filename, like memo.txt is also considered a path,\nbut it is a relative path because it relates to the current\ndirectory. If the current directory is /home/dinsdale , the\nfilename memo.txt would refer to /home/dinsdale/memo.txt . A path that begins with / does not depend on the current\ndirectory; it is called an absolute path . To find the absolute\npath to a file, you can use os.path.abspath : >>> os.path.abspath('memo.txt')\n'/home/dinsdale/memo.txt' os.path provides other functions for working with filenames\nand paths. For example, os.path.exists checks\nwhether a file or directory exists: >>> os.path.exists('memo.txt')\nTrue If it exists, os.path.isdir checks whether it’s a directory: >>> os.path.isdir('memo.txt')\nFalse\n>>> os.path.isdir('/home/dinsdale')\nTrue Similarly, os.path.isfile checks whether it’s a file. os.listdir returns a list of the files (and other directories)\nin the given directory: >>> os.listdir(cwd)\n['music', 'photos', 'memo.txt'] To demonstrate these functions, the following example\n“walks” through a directory, prints\nthe names of all the files, and calls itself recursively on\nall the directories. def walk(dirname):\n    for name in os.listdir(dirname):\n        path = os.path.join(dirname, name)\n\n        if os.path.isfile(path):\n            print(path)\n        else:\n            walk(path) os.path.join takes a directory and a file name and joins\nthem into a complete path. The os module provides a function called walk that is\nsimilar to this one but more versatile. As an exercise, read the\ndocumentation and use it to print the names of the files in a given\ndirectory and its subdirectories. You can download my solution from https://thinkpython.com/code/walk.py . 14.5  Catching exceptions A lot of things can go wrong when you try to read and write\nfiles. If you try to open a file that doesn’t exist, you get an FileNotFoundError : >>> fin = open('bad_file')\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'bad_file' If you don’t have permission to access a file: >>> fout = open('/etc/passwd', 'w')\nPermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/etc/passwd' And if you try to open a directory for reading, you get >>> fin = open('/home')\nIsADirectoryError: [Errno 21] Is a directory: '/home' To avoid these errors, you could use functions like os.path.exists and os.path.isfile , but it would take a lot of time and code\nto check all the possibilities (if “ Errno 21 ” is any\nindication, there are at least 21 things that can go wrong). It is better to go ahead and try—and deal with problems if they\nhappen—which is exactly what the try statement does. The\nsyntax is similar to an if...else statement: try:    \n    fin = open('bad_file')\nexcept:\n    print('Something went wrong.') Python starts by executing the try clause. If all goes\nwell, it skips the except clause and proceeds. If an\nexception occurs, it jumps out of the try clause and\nruns the except clause. Handling an exception with a try statement is called catching an exception. In this example, the except clause\nprints an error message that is not very helpful. In general,\ncatching an exception gives you a chance to fix the problem, or try\nagain, or at least end the program gracefully. 14.6  Databases A database is a file that is organized for storing data. Many\ndatabases are organized like a dictionary in the sense that they map\nfrom keys to values. The biggest difference between a database and a\ndictionary is that the database is on disk (or other permanent\nstorage), so it persists after the program ends. The module dbm provides an interface for creating\nand updating database files.\nAs an example, I’ll create a database\nthat contains captions for image files. Opening a database is similar to opening other files: >>> import dbm\n>>> db = dbm.open('captions', 'c') The mode 'c' means that the database should be created if\nit doesn’t already exist. The result is a database object\nthat can be used (for most operations) like a dictionary. When you create a new item, dbm updates the database file. >>> db['cleese.png'] = 'Photo of John Cleese.' When you access one of the items, dbm reads the file: >>> db['cleese.png']\nb'Photo of John Cleese.' The result is a bytes object , which is why it begins with b . A bytes object is similar to a string in many ways. When you\nget farther into Python, the difference becomes important, but for now\nwe can ignore it. If you make another assignment to an existing key, dbm replaces\nthe old value: >>> db['cleese.png'] = 'Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.'\n>>> db['cleese.png']\nb'Photo of John Cleese doing a silly walk.' Some dictionary methods, like keys and items , don’t\nwork with database objects. But iteration with a for loop works: for key in db.keys():\n    print(key, db[key]) As with other files, you should close the database when you are\ndone: >>> db.close() 14.7  Pickling A limitation of dbm is that the keys and values have to be\nstrings or bytes. If you try to use any other type, you get an error. The pickle module can help. It translates\nalmost any type of object into a string suitable for storage in a\ndatabase, and then translates strings back into objects. pickle.dumps takes an object as a parameter and returns\na string representation ( dumps is short for “dump string”): >>> import pickle\n>>> t = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> pickle.dumps(t)\nb'\\x80\\x03]q\\x00(K\\x01K\\x02K\\x03e.' The format isn’t obvious to human readers; it is meant to be\neasy for pickle to interpret. pickle.loads (“load string”) reconstitutes the object: >>> t1 = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> s = pickle.dumps(t1)\n>>> t2 = pickle.loads(s)\n>>> t2\n[1, 2, 3] Although the new object has the same value as the old, it is\nnot (in general) the same object: >>> t1 == t2\nTrue\n>>> t1 is t2\nFalse In other words, pickling and then unpickling has the same effect\nas copying the object. You can use pickle to store non-strings in a database.\nIn fact, this combination is so common that it has been\nencapsulated in a module called shelve . 14.8  Pipes Most operating systems provide a command-line interface,\nalso known as a shell . Shells usually provide commands\nto navigate the file system and launch applications. For\nexample, in Unix you can change directories with cd ,\ndisplay the contents of a directory with ls , and launch\na web browser by typing (for example) firefox . Any program that you can launch from the shell can also be\nlaunched from Python using a pipe object , which\nrepresents a running program. For example, the Unix command ls -l normally displays the\ncontents of the current directory in long format. You can\nlaunch ls with os.popen 1 : >>> cmd = 'ls -l'\n>>> fp = os.popen(cmd) The argument is a string that contains a shell command. The\nreturn value is an object that behaves like an open\nfile. You can read the output from the ls process one\nline at a time with readline or get the whole thing at\nonce with read : >>> res = fp.read() When you are done, you close the pipe like a file: >>> stat = fp.close()\n>>> print(stat)\nNone The return value is the final status of the ls process; None means that it ended normally (with no errors). For example, most Unix systems provide a command called md5sum that reads the contents of a file and computes a “checksum”.\nYou can read about MD5 at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5 . This\ncommand provides an efficient way to check whether two files\nhave the same contents. The probability that different contents\nyield the same checksum is very small (that is, unlikely to happen\nbefore the universe collapses). You can use a pipe to run md5sum from Python and get the result: >>> filename = 'book.tex'\n>>> cmd = 'md5sum ' + filename\n>>> fp = os.popen(cmd)\n>>> res = fp.read()\n>>> stat = fp.close()\n>>> print(res)\n1e0033f0ed0656636de0d75144ba32e0  book.tex\n>>> print(stat)\nNone 14.9  Writing modules Any file that contains Python code can be imported as a module.\nFor example, suppose you have a file named wc.py with the following\ncode: def linecount(filename):\n    count = 0\n    for line in open(filename):\n        count += 1\n    return count\n\nprint(linecount('wc.py')) If you run this program, it reads itself and prints the number\nof lines in the file, which is 7.\nYou can also import it like this: >>> import wc\n7 Now you have a module object wc : >>> wc\n<module 'wc' from 'wc.py'> The module object provides linecount : >>> wc.linecount('wc.py')\n7 So that’s how you write modules in Python. The only problem with this example is that when you import\nthe module it runs the test code at the bottom. Normally\nwhen you import a module, it defines new functions but it\ndoesn’t run them. Programs that will be imported as modules often\nuse the following idiom: if __name__ == '__main__':\n    print(linecount('wc.py')) __name__ is a built-in variable that is set when the\nprogram starts. If the program is running as a script, __name__ has the value '__main__' ; in that\ncase, the test code runs. Otherwise,\nif the module is being imported, the test code is skipped. As an exercise, type this example into a file named wc.py and run\nit as a script. Then run the Python interpreter and import wc . What is the value of __name__ when the module is being imported? Warning: If you import a module that has already been imported,\nPython does nothing. It does not re-read the file, even if it has\nchanged. If you want to reload a module, you can use the built-in function reload , but it can be tricky, so the safest thing to do is\nrestart the interpreter and then import the module again. 14.10  Debugging When you are reading and writing files, you might run into problems\nwith whitespace. These errors can be hard to debug because spaces,\ntabs and newlines are normally invisible: >>> s = '1 2\\t 3\\n 4'\n>>> print(s)\n1 2  3\n 4 The built-in function repr can help. It takes any object as an\nargument and returns a string representation of the object. For\nstrings, it represents whitespace\ncharacters with backslash sequences: >>> print(repr(s))\n'1 2\\t 3\\n 4' This can be helpful for debugging. One other problem you might run into is that different systems\nuse different characters to indicate the end of a line. Some\nsystems use a newline, represented \\n . Others use\na return character, represented \\r . Some use both.\nIf you move files between different systems, these inconsistencies\ncan cause problems. For most systems, there are applications to convert from one\nformat to another. You can find them (and read more about this\nissue) at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline . Or, of course, you\ncould write one yourself. 14.11  Glossary persistent: Pertaining to a program that runs indefinitely\nand keeps at least some of its data in permanent storage. format operator: An operator, % , that takes a format\nstring and a tuple and generates a string that includes\nthe elements of the tuple formatted as specified by the format string. format string: A string, used with the format operator, that\ncontains format sequences. format sequence: A sequence of characters in a format string,\nlike %d , that specifies how a value should be formatted. text file: A sequence of characters stored in permanent\nstorage like a hard drive. directory: A named collection of files, also called a folder. path: A string that identifies a file. relative path: A path that starts from the current directory. absolute path: A path that starts from the topmost directory\nin the file system. catch: To prevent an exception from terminating\na program using the try and except statements. database: A file whose contents are organized like a dictionary\nwith keys that correspond to values. bytes object: An object similar to a string. shell: A program that allows users to type commands and then\nexecutes them by starting other programs. pipe object: An object that represents a running program, allowing\na Python program to run commands and read the results. 14.12  Exercises Exercise 1 Write a function called sed that takes as arguments a pattern string,\na replacement string, and two filenames; it should read the first file\nand write the contents into the second file (creating it if\nnecessary). If the pattern string appears anywhere in the file, it\nshould be replaced with the replacement string. If an error occurs while opening, reading, writing or closing files,\nyour program should catch the exception, print an error message, and\nexit. Solution: https://thinkpython.com/code/sed.py . Exercise 2 If you download my solution to Exercise 2 from https://thinkpython.com/code/anagram_sets.py , you’ll see that it creates\na dictionary that maps from a sorted string of letters to the list of\nwords that can be spelled with those letters. For example, 'opst' maps to the list ['opts', 'post', 'pots', 'spot', 'stop', 'tops'] . Write a module that imports anagram_sets and provides\ntwo new functions: store_anagrams should store the\nanagram dictionary in a “shelf”; read_anagrams should\nlook up a word and return a list of its anagrams.\nSolution: https://thinkpython.com/code/anagram_db.py . Exercise 3 In a large collection of MP3 files, there may be more than one\ncopy of the same song, stored in different directories or with\ndifferent file names. The goal of this exercise is to search for\nduplicates. Write a program that searches a directory and all of its\nsubdirectories, recursively, and returns a list of complete paths\nfor all files with a given suffix (like .mp3 ).\nHint: os.path provides several useful functions for\nmanipulating file and path names. To recognize duplicates, you can use md5sum to compute a “checksum” for each files. If two files have\nthe same checksum, they probably have the same contents. To double-check, you can use the Unix command diff . Solution: https://thinkpython.com/code/find_duplicates.py . 1 popen is deprecated\nnow, which means we are supposed to stop using it and start using\nthe subprocess module. But for simple cases, I find subprocess more complicated than necessary. So I am going\nto keep using popen until they take it away.
