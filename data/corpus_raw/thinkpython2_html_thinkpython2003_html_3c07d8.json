A variable is a name that\nrefers to a value. 2.1  Assignment statements An assignment statement creates a new variable and gives\nit a value: >>> message = 'And now for something completely different'\n>>> n = 17\n>>> pi = 3.1415926535897932 This example makes three assignments. The first assigns a string\nto a new variable named message ;\nthe second gives the integer 17 to n ; the third\nassigns the (approximate) value of π to pi . A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with\nan arrow pointing to its value. This kind of figure is\ncalled a state diagram because it shows what state each of the\nvariables is in (think of it as the variable’s state of mind).\nFigure 2.1 shows the result of the previous example. Figure 2.1: State diagram. 2.2  Variable names Programmers generally choose names for their variables that\nare meaningful—they document what the variable is used for. Variable names can be as long as you like. They can contain\nboth letters and numbers, but they can’t begin with a number.\nIt is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is conventional\nto use only lower case for variables names. The underscore character, _ , can appear in a name.\nIt is often used in names with multiple words, such as your_name or airspeed_of_unladen_swallow . If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error: >>> 76trombones = 'big parade'\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n>>> more@ = 1000000\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n>>> class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy'\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax 76trombones is illegal because it begins with a number. more@ is illegal because it contains an illegal character, @ . But what’s wrong with class ? It turns out that class is one of Python’s keywords . The\ninterpreter uses keywords to recognize the structure of the program,\nand they cannot be used as variable names. Python 3 has these keywords: False      class      finally    is         return\nNone       continue   for        lambda     try\nTrue       def        from       nonlocal   while\nand        del        global     not        with\nas         elif       if         or         yield\nassert     else       import     pass\nbreak      except     in         raise You don’t have to memorize this list. In most development environments,\nkeywords are displayed in a different color; if you try to use one\nas a variable name, you’ll know. 2.3  Expressions and statements An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators.\nA value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is\na variable, so the following are all legal expressions: >>> 42\n42\n>>> n\n17\n>>> n + 25\n42 When you type an expression at the prompt, the interpreter evaluates it, which means that it finds the value of\nthe expression.\nIn this example, n has the value 17 and n + 25 has the value 42. A statement is a unit of code that has an effect, like\ncreating a variable or displaying a value. >>> n = 17\n>>> print(n) The first line is an assignment statement that gives a value to n . The second line is a print statement that displays the\nvalue of n . When you type a statement, the interpreter executes it,\nwhich means that it does whatever the statement says. In general,\nstatements don’t have values. 2.4  Script mode So far we have run Python in interactive mode , which\nmeans that you interact directly with the interpreter.\nInteractive mode is a good way to get started,\nbut if you are working with more than a few lines of code, it can be\nclumsy. The alternative is to save code in a file called a script and\nthen run the interpreter in script mode to execute the script. By\nconvention, Python scripts have names that end with .py . If you know how to create and run a script on your computer, you\nare ready to go. Otherwise I recommend using PythonAnywhere again.\nI have posted instructions for running in script mode at http://tinyurl.com/thinkpython2e . Because Python provides both modes,\nyou can test bits of code in interactive mode before you put them\nin a script. But there are differences between interactive mode\nand script mode that can be confusing. For example, if you are using Python as a calculator, you might type >>> miles = 26.2\n>>> miles * 1.61\n42.182 The first line assigns a value to miles , but it has no visible\neffect. The second line is an expression, so the\ninterpreter evaluates it and displays the result. It turns out that a\nmarathon is about 42 kilometers. But if you type the same code into a script and run it, you get no\noutput at all. \nIn script mode an expression, all by itself, has no\nvisible effect. Python evaluates the expression, but it doesn’t\ndisplay the result.\nTo display the result, you need a print statement like this: miles = 26.2\nprint(miles * 1.61) This behavior can be confusing at first.\nTo check your understanding, type the following statements in the\nPython interpreter and see what they do: 5\nx = 5\nx + 1 Now put the same statements in a script and run it. What\nis the output? Modify the script by transforming each\nexpression into a print statement and then run it again. 2.5  Order of operations When an expression contains more than one operator, the order of\nevaluation depends on the order of operations . For\nmathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention.\nThe acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to\nremember the rules: P arentheses have the highest precedence and can be used \nto force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. Since\nexpressions in parentheses are evaluated first, 2 * (3-1) is 4,\nand (1+1)**(5-2) is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an\nexpression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60 , even\nif it doesn’t change the result. E xponentiation has the next highest precedence, so 1 + 2**3 is 9, not 27, and 2 * 3**2 is 18, not 36. M ultiplication and D ivision have higher precedence\nthan A ddition and S ubtraction. So 2*3-1 is 5, not\n4, and 6+4/2 is 8, not 5. Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to\nright (except exponentiation). So in the expression degrees /\n2 * pi , the division happens first and the result is multiplied\nby pi . To divide by 2 π, you can use parentheses or write degrees / 2 / pi . I don’t work very hard to remember the precedence of\noperators. If I can’t tell by looking at the expression, I use\nparentheses to make it obvious. 2.6  String operations In general, you can’t perform mathematical operations on strings, even\nif the strings look like numbers, so the following are illegal: 'chinese'-'food'    'eggs'/'easy'    'third'*'a charm' But there are two exceptions, + and * . The + operator performs string concatenation , which means\nit joins the strings by linking them end-to-end. For example: >>> first = 'throat'\n>>> second = 'warbler'\n>>> first + second\nthroatwarbler The * operator also works on strings; it performs repetition.\nFor example, 'Spam'*3 is 'SpamSpamSpam' . If one of the\nvalues is a string, the other has to be an integer. This use of + and * makes sense by\nanalogy with addition and multiplication. Just as 4*3 is\nequivalent to 4+4+4 , we expect 'Spam'*3 to be the same as 'Spam'+'Spam'+'Spam' , and it is. On the other hand, there is a\nsignificant way in which string concatenation and repetition are\ndifferent from integer addition and multiplication.\nCan you think of a property that addition has\nthat string concatenation does not? 2.7  Comments As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult\nto read. Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to\nlook at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why. For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain\nin natural language what the program is doing. These notes are called comments , and they start with the # symbol: # compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed\npercentage = (minute * 100) / 60 In this case, the comment appears on a line by itself. You can also put\ncomments at the end of a line: percentage = (minute * 100) / 60     # percentage of an hour Everything from the # to the end of the line is ignored—it\nhas no effect on the execution of the program. Comments are most useful when they document non-obvious features of\nthe code. It is reasonable to assume that the reader can figure out what the code does; it is more useful to explain why . This comment is redundant with the code and useless: v = 5     # assign 5 to v This comment contains useful information that is not in the code: v = 5     # velocity in meters/second. Good variable names can reduce the need for comments, but\nlong names can make complex expressions hard to read, so there is\na tradeoff. 2.8  Debugging Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: syntax errors, runtime \nerrors, and semantic errors. It is useful\nto distinguish between them in order to track them down more quickly. Syntax error: “Syntax” refers to the structure of a program\nand the rules about that structure. For example, parentheses have\nto come in matching pairs, so (1 + 2) is legal, but 8) is a syntax error . If there is a syntax error\nanywhere in your program, Python displays an error message and quits,\nand you will not be able to run the program. During the first few\nweeks of your programming career, you might spend a lot of\ntime tracking down syntax errors. As you gain experience, you will\nmake fewer errors and find them faster. Runtime error: The second type of error is a runtime error, so\ncalled because the error does not appear until after the program has\nstarted running. These errors are also called exceptions because they usually indicate that something exceptional (and bad)\nhas happened. Runtime errors are rare in the simple programs you will see in the\nfirst few chapters, so it might be a while before you encounter one. Semantic error: The third type of error is “semantic”, which\nmeans related to meaning. If there is a semantic error in your\nprogram, it will run without generating error messages, but it will\nnot do the right thing. It will do something else. Specifically,\nit will do what you told it to do. Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work\nbackward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure\nout what it is doing. 2.9  Glossary variable: A name that refers to a value. assignment: A statement that assigns a value to a variable. state diagram: A graphical representation of a set of variables and the\nvalues they refer to. keyword: A reserved word that is used to parse a\nprogram; you cannot use keywords like if , def , and while as\nvariable names. operand: One of the values on which an operator operates. expression: A combination of variables, operators, and values that\nrepresents a single result. evaluate: To simplify an expression by performing the operations\nin order to yield a single value. statement: A section of code that represents a command or action. So\nfar, the statements we have seen are assignments and print statements. execute: To run a statement and do what it says. interactive mode: A way of using the Python interpreter by\ntyping code at the prompt. script mode: A way of using the Python interpreter to read\ncode from a script and run it. script: A program stored in a file. order of operations: Rules governing the order in which\nexpressions involving multiple operators and operands are evaluated. concatenate: To join two operands end-to-end. comment: Information in a program that is meant for other\nprogrammers (or anyone reading the source code) and has no effect on the\nexecution of the program. syntax error: An error in a program that makes it impossible\nto parse (and therefore impossible to interpret). exception: An error that is detected while the program is running. semantics: The meaning of a program. semantic error: An error in a program that makes it do something\nother than what the programmer intended. 2.10  Exercises Exercise 1 Repeating my advice from the previous chapter, whenever you learn\na new feature, you should try it out in interactive mode and make\nerrors on purpose to see what goes wrong. We’ve seen that n = 42 is legal. What about 42 = n ? How about x = y = 1 ? In some languages every statement ends with a semi-colon, ; .\nWhat happens if you put a semi-colon at the end of a Python statement? What if you put a period at the end of a statement? In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: x y .\nWhat happens if you try that in Python? Exercise 2 Practice using the Python interpreter as a calculator: The volume of a sphere with radius r is 4/3 π r 3 .\nWhat is the volume of a sphere with radius 5? Suppose the cover price of a book is $24.95, but bookstores get a\n40% discount. Shipping costs $3 for the first copy and 75 cents\nfor each additional copy. What is the total wholesale cost for\n60 copies? If I leave my house at 6:52 am and run 1 mile at an easy pace\n(8:15 per mile), then 3 miles at tempo (7:12 per mile) and 1 mile at\neasy pace again, what time do I get home for breakfast?
