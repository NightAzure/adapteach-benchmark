  "content": "# 4.More Control Flow ToolsÂ¶\n\nAs well as the while statement just introduced, Python uses a few more\nthat we will encounter in this chapter.\n\n## 4.1.ifStatementsÂ¶\n\nPerhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement.  For\nexample:\n\n```python\n>>> x = int(input(\"Please enter an integer: \"))\nPlease enter an integer: 42\n>>> if x < 0:\n...     x = 0\n...     print('Negative changed to zero')\n... elif x == 0:\n...     print('Zero')\n... elif x == 1:\n...     print('Single')\n... else:\n...     print('More')\n...\nMore\n```\n\nThere can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is\noptional.  The keyword â elif â is short for âelse ifâ, and is useful\nto avoid excessive indentation.  An if â¦ elif â¦ elif â¦ sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.\n\nIf youâre comparing the same value to several constants, or checking for specific types or\nattributes, you may also find the match statement useful. For more\ndetails see match Statements .\n\n## 4.2.forStatementsÂ¶\n\nThe for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used\nto in C or Pascal.  Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression\nof numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the\niteration step and halting condition (as C), Pythonâs for statement\niterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that\nthey appear in the sequence.  For example (no pun intended):\n\n```python\n>>> # Measure some strings:\n>>> words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']\n>>> for w in words:\n...     print(w, len(w))\n...\ncat 3\nwindow 6\ndefenestrate 12\n```\n\nCode that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can\nbe tricky to get right.  Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop\nover a copy of the collection or to create a new collection:\n\n```python\n# Create a sample collection\nusers = {'Hans': 'active', 'ÃlÃ©onore': 'inactive', 'æ¯å¤ªé': 'active'}\n\n# Strategy:  Iterate over a copy\nfor user, status in users.copy().items():\n    if status == 'inactive':\n        del users[user]\n\n# Strategy:  Create a new collection\nactive_users = {}\nfor user, status in users.items():\n    if status == 'active':\n        active_users[user] = status\n```\n\n## 4.3.Therange()FunctionÂ¶\n\nIf you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in function range() comes in handy.  It generates arithmetic progressions:\n\n```python\n>>> for i in range(5):\n...     print(i)\n...\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n```\n\nThe given end point is never part of the generated sequence; range(10) generates\n10 values, the legal indices for items of a sequence of length 10.  It\nis possible to let the range start at another number, or to specify a different\nincrement (even negative; sometimes this is called the âstepâ):\n\n```python\n>>> list(range(5, 10))\n[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\n>>> list(range(0, 10, 3))\n[0, 3, 6, 9]\n\n>>> list(range(-10, -100, -30))\n[-10, -40, -70]\n```\n\nTo iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine range() and len() as follows:\n\n```python\n>>> a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']\n>>> for i in range(len(a)):\n...     print(i, a[i])\n...\n0 Mary\n1 had\n2 a\n3 little\n4 lamb\n```\n\nIn most such cases, however, it is convenient to use the enumerate() function, see Looping Techniques .\n\nA strange thing happens if you just print a range:\n\n```python\n>>> range(10)\nrange(0, 10)\n```\n\nIn many ways the object returned by range() behaves as if it is a list,\nbut in fact it isnât. It is an object which returns the successive items of\nthe desired sequence when you iterate over it, but it doesnât really make\nthe list, thus saving space.\n\nWe say such an object is iterable , that is, suitable as a target for\nfunctions and constructs that expect something from which they can\nobtain successive items until the supply is exhausted.  We have seen that\nthe for statement is such a construct, while an example of a function\nthat takes an iterable is sum() :\n\n```python\n>>> sum(range(4))  # 0 + 1 + 2 + 3\n6\n```\n\nLater we will see more functions that return iterables and take iterables as\narguments.  In chapter Data Structures , we will discuss list() in more\ndetail.\n\n## 4.4.breakandcontinueStatementsÂ¶\n\nThe break statement breaks out of the innermost enclosing for or while loop:\n\n```python\n>>> for n in range(2, 10):\n...     for x in range(2, n):\n...         if n % x == 0:\n...             print(f\"{n} equals {x} * {n//x}\")\n...             break\n...\n4 equals 2 * 2\n6 equals 2 * 3\n8 equals 2 * 4\n9 equals 3 * 3\n```\n\nThe continue statement continues with the next\niteration of the loop:\n\n```python\n>>> for num in range(2, 10):\n...     if num % 2 == 0:\n...         print(f\"Found an even number {num}\")\n...         continue\n...     print(f\"Found an odd number {num}\")\n...\nFound an even number 2\nFound an odd number 3\nFound an even number 4\nFound an odd number 5\nFound an even number 6\nFound an odd number 7\nFound an even number 8\nFound an odd number 9\n```\n\n## 4.5.elseClauses on LoopsÂ¶\n\nIn a for or while loop the break statement\nmay be paired with an else clause.  If the loop finishes without\nexecuting the break , the else clause executes.\n\nIn a for loop, the else clause is executed\nafter the loop finishes its final iteration, that is, if no break occurred.\n\nIn a while loop, itâs executed after the loopâs condition becomes false.\n\nIn either kind of loop, the else clause is not executed if the\nloop was terminated by a break .  Of course, other ways of ending the\nloop early, such as a return or a raised exception, will also skip\nexecution of the else clause.\n\nThis is exemplified in the following for loop,\nwhich searches for prime numbers:\n\n```python\n>>> for n in range(2, 10):\n...     for x in range(2, n):\n...         if n % x == 0:\n...             print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)\n...             break\n...     else:\n...         # loop fell through without finding a factor\n...         print(n, 'is a prime number')\n...\n2 is a prime number\n3 is a prime number\n4 equals 2 * 2\n5 is a prime number\n6 equals 2 * 3\n7 is a prime number\n8 equals 2 * 4\n9 equals 3 * 3\n```\n\n(Yes, this is the correct code.  Look closely: the else clause belongs to\nthe for loop, not the if statement.)\n\nOne way to think of the else clause is to imagine it paired with the if inside the loop.  As the loop executes, it will run a sequence like\nif/if/if/else. The if is inside the loop, encountered a number of times. If\nthe condition is ever true, a break will happen. If the condition is never\ntrue, the else clause outside the loop will execute.\n\nWhen used with a loop, the else clause has more in common with the else clause of a try statement than it does with that of if statements: a try statementâs else clause runs when no exception\noccurs, and a loopâs else clause runs when no break occurs. For more on\nthe try statement and exceptions, see Handling Exceptions .\n\n## 4.6.passStatementsÂ¶\n\nThe pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is\nrequired syntactically but the program requires no action. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> while True:\n...     pass  # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)\n...\n```\n\nThis is commonly used for creating minimal classes:\n\n```python\n>>> class MyEmptyClass:\n...     pass\n...\n```\n\nAnother place pass can be used is as a place-holder for a function or\nconditional body when you are working on new code, allowing you to keep thinking\nat a more abstract level.  The pass is silently ignored:\n\n```python\n>>> def initlog(*args):\n...     pass   # Remember to implement this!\n...\n```\n\nFor this last case, many people use the ellipsis literal ... instead of pass . This use has no special meaning to Python, and is not part of\nthe language definition (you could use any constant expression here), but ... is used conventionally as a placeholder body as well.\nSee The Ellipsis Object .\n\n## 4.7.matchStatementsÂ¶\n\nA match statement takes an expression and compares its value to successive\npatterns given as one or more case blocks.  This is superficially\nsimilar to a switch statement in C, Java or JavaScript (and many\nother languages), but itâs more similar to pattern matching in\nlanguages like Rust or Haskell. Only the first pattern that matches\ngets executed and it can also extract components (sequence elements\nor object attributes) from the value into variables. If no case matches,\nnone of the branches is executed.\n\nThe simplest form compares a subject value against one or more literals:\n\n```python\ndef http_error(status):\n    match status:\n        case 400:\n            return \"Bad request\"\n        case 404:\n            return \"Not found\"\n        case 418:\n            return \"I'm a teapot\"\n        case _:\n            return \"Something's wrong with the internet\"\n```\n\nNote the last block: the âvariable nameâ _ acts as a wildcard and\nnever fails to match.\n\nYou can combine several literals in a single pattern using | (âorâ):\n\n```python\ncase 401 | 403 | 404:\n    return \"Not allowed\"\n```\n\nPatterns can look like unpacking assignments, and can be used to bind\nvariables:\n\n```python\n# point is an (x, y) tuple\nmatch point:\n    case (0, 0):\n        print(\"Origin\")\n    case (0, y):\n        print(f\"Y={y}\")\n    case (x, 0):\n        print(f\"X={x}\")\n    case (x, y):\n        print(f\"X={x}, Y={y}\")\n    case _:\n        raise ValueError(\"Not a point\")\n```\n\nStudy that one carefully!  The first pattern has two literals, and can\nbe thought of as an extension of the literal pattern shown above.  But\nthe next two patterns combine a literal and a variable, and the\nvariable binds a value from the subject ( point ).  The fourth\npattern captures two values, which makes it conceptually similar to\nthe unpacking assignment (x, y) = point .\n\nIf you are using classes to structure your data\nyou can use the class name followed by an argument list resembling a\nconstructor, but with the ability to capture attributes into variables:\n\n```python\nclass Point:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\ndef where_is(point):\n    match point:\n        case Point(x=0, y=0):\n            print(\"Origin\")\n        case Point(x=0, y=y):\n            print(f\"Y={y}\")\n        case Point(x=x, y=0):\n            print(f\"X={x}\")\n        case Point():\n            print(\"Somewhere else\")\n        case _:\n            print(\"Not a point\")\n```\n\nYou can use positional parameters with some builtin classes that provide an\nordering for their attributes (e.g. dataclasses). You can also define a specific\nposition for attributes in patterns by setting the __match_args__ special\nattribute in your classes. If itâs set to (âxâ, âyâ), the following patterns are all\nequivalent (and all bind the y attribute to the var variable):\n\n```python\nPoint(1, var)\nPoint(1, y=var)\nPoint(x=1, y=var)\nPoint(y=var, x=1)\n```\n\nA recommended way to read patterns is to look at them as an extended form of what you\nwould put on the left of an assignment, to understand which variables would be set to\nwhat.\nOnly the standalone names (like var above) are assigned to by a match statement.\nDotted names (like foo.bar ), attribute names (the x= and y= above) or class names\n(recognized by the â(â¦)â next to them like Point above) are never assigned to.\n\nPatterns can be arbitrarily nested.  For example, if we have a short\nlist of Points, with __match_args__ added, we could match it like this:\n\n```python\nclass Point:\n    __match_args__ = ('x', 'y')\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\nmatch points:\n    case []:\n        print(\"No points\")\n    case [Point(0, 0)]:\n        print(\"The origin\")\n    case [Point(x, y)]:\n        print(f\"Single point {x}, {y}\")\n    case [Point(0, y1), Point(0, y2)]:\n        print(f\"Two on the Y axis at {y1}, {y2}\")\n    case _:\n        print(\"Something else\")\n```\n\nWe can add an if clause to a pattern, known as a âguardâ.  If the\nguard is false, match goes on to try the next case block.  Note\nthat value capture happens before the guard is evaluated:\n\n```python\nmatch point:\n    case Point(x, y) if x == y:\n        print(f\"Y=X at {x}\")\n    case Point(x, y):\n        print(f\"Not on the diagonal\")\n```\n\nSeveral other key features of this statement:\n\n- Like unpacking assignments, tuple and list patterns have exactly the\nsame meaning and actually match arbitrary sequences.  An important\nexception is that they donât match iterators or strings.\n- Sequence patterns support extended unpacking: [x, y, *rest] and (x, y, *rest) work similar to unpacking assignments.  The\nname after * may also be _ , so (x, y, *_) matches a sequence\nof at least two items without binding the remaining items.\n- Mapping patterns: {\"bandwidth\": b, \"latency\": l} captures the \"bandwidth\" and \"latency\" values from a dictionary.  Unlike sequence\npatterns, extra keys are ignored.  An unpacking like **rest is also\nsupported.  (But **_ would be redundant, so it is not allowed.)\n- Subpatterns may be captured using the as keyword: case ( Point ( x1 , y1 ), Point ( x2 , y2 ) as p2 ): ... will capture the second element of the input as p2 (as long as the input is\na sequence of two points)\n- Most literals are compared by equality, however the singletons True , False and None are compared by identity.\n- Patterns may use named constants.  These must be dotted names\nto prevent them from being interpreted as capture variables: from enum import Enum class Color ( Enum ): RED = 'red' GREEN = 'green' BLUE = 'blue' color = Color ( input ( \"Enter your choice of 'red', 'blue' or 'green': \" )) match color : case Color . RED : print ( \"I see red!\" ) case Color . GREEN : print ( \"Grass is green\" ) case Color . BLUE : print ( \"I'm feeling the blues :(\" )\n\nFor a more detailed explanation and additional examples, you can look into PEP 636 which is written in a tutorial format.\n\n## 4.8.Defining FunctionsÂ¶\n\nWe can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary\nboundary:\n\n```python\n>>> def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series less than n\n...     \"\"\"Print a Fibonacci series less than n.\"\"\"\n...     a, b = 0, 1\n...     while a < n:\n...         print(a, end=' ')\n...         a, b = b, a+b\n...     print()\n...\n>>> # Now call the function we just defined:\n>>> fib(2000)\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597\n```\n\nThe keyword def introduces a function definition .  It must be\nfollowed by the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters.\nThe statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and\nmust be indented.\n\nThe first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal;\nthis string literal is the functionâs documentation string, or docstring .\n(More about docstrings can be found in the section Documentation Strings .)\nThere are tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed\ndocumentation, or to let the user interactively browse through code; itâs good\npractice to include docstrings in code that you write, so make a habit of it.\n\nThe execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local\nvariables of the function.  More precisely, all variable assignments in a\nfunction store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references\nfirst look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of\nenclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table\nof built-in names. Thus, global variables and variables of enclosing functions\ncannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless, for global\nvariables, named in a global statement, or, for variables of enclosing\nfunctions, named in a nonlocal statement), although they may be\nreferenced.\n\nThe actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the local\nsymbol table of the called function when it is called; thus, arguments are\npassed using call by value (where the value is always an object reference ,\nnot the value of the object). [ 1 ] When a function calls another function,\nor calls itself recursively, a new\nlocal symbol table is created for that call.\n\nA function definition associates the function name with the function object in\nthe current symbol table.  The interpreter recognizes the object pointed to by\nthat name as a user-defined function.  Other names can also point to that same\nfunction object and can also be used to access the function:\n\n```python\n>>> fib\n<function fib at 10042ed0>\n>>> f = fib\n>>> f(100)\n0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89\n```\n\nComing from other languages, you might object that fib is not a function but\na procedure since it doesnât return a value.  In fact, even functions without a return statement do return a value, albeit a rather boring one.  This\nvalue is called None (itâs a built-in name).  Writing the value None is\nnormally suppressed by the interpreter if it would be the only value written.\nYou can see it if you really want to using print() :\n\n```python\n>>> fib(0)\n>>> print(fib(0))\nNone\n```\n\nIt is simple to write a function that returns a list of the numbers of the\nFibonacci series, instead of printing it:\n\n```python\n>>> def fib2(n):  # return Fibonacci series up to n\n...     \"\"\"Return a list containing the Fibonacci series up to n.\"\"\"\n...     result = []\n...     a, b = 0, 1\n...     while a < n:\n...         result.append(a)    # see below\n...         a, b = b, a+b\n...     return result\n...\n>>> f100 = fib2(100)    # call it\n>>> f100                # write the result\n[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]\n```\n\nThis example, as usual, demonstrates some new Python features:\n\n- The return statement returns with a value from a function. return without an expression argument returns None . Falling off\nthe end of a function also returns None .\n- The statement result.append(a) calls a method of the list object result .  A method is a function that âbelongsâ to an object and is named obj.methodname , where obj is some object (this may be an expression),\nand methodname is the name of a method that is defined by the objectâs type.\nDifferent types define different methods.  Methods of different types may have\nthe same name without causing ambiguity.  (It is possible to define your own\nobject types and methods, using classes , see Classes )\nThe method append() shown in the example is defined for list objects; it\nadds a new element at the end of the list.  In this example it is equivalent to result = result + [a] , but more efficient.\n\n## 4.9.More on Defining FunctionsÂ¶\n\nIt is also possible to define functions with a variable number of arguments.\nThere are three forms, which can be combined.\n\n### 4.9.1.Default Argument ValuesÂ¶\n\nThe most useful form is to specify a default value for one or more arguments.\nThis creates a function that can be called with fewer arguments than it is\ndefined to allow.  For example:\n\n```python\ndef ask_ok(prompt, retries=4, reminder='Please try again!'):\n    while True:\n        reply = input(prompt)\n        if reply in {'y', 'ye', 'yes'}:\n            return True\n        if reply in {'n', 'no', 'nop', 'nope'}:\n            return False\n        retries = retries - 1\n        if retries < 0:\n            raise ValueError('invalid user response')\n        print(reminder)\n```\n\nThis function can be called in several ways:\n\n- giving only the mandatory argument: ask_ok('Do you really want to quit?')\n- giving one of the optional arguments: ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2)\n- or even giving all arguments: ask_ok('OK to overwrite the file?', 2, 'Come on, only yes or no!')\n\nThis example also introduces the in keyword. This tests whether or\nnot a sequence contains a certain value.\n\nThe default values are evaluated at the point of function definition in the defining scope, so that\n\n```python\ni = 5\n\ndef f(arg=i):\n    print(arg)\n\ni = 6\nf()\n```\n\nwill print 5 .\n\nImportant warning: The default value is evaluated only once. This makes a\ndifference when the default is a mutable object such as a list, dictionary, or\ninstances of most classes.  For example, the following function accumulates the\narguments passed to it on subsequent calls:\n\n```python\ndef f(a, L=[]):\n    L.append(a)\n    return L\n\nprint(f(1))\nprint(f(2))\nprint(f(3))\n```\n\nThis will print\n\n```python\n[1]\n[1, 2]\n[1, 2, 3]\n```\n\nIf you donât want the default to be shared between subsequent calls, you can\nwrite the function like this instead:\n\n```python\ndef f(a, L=None):\n    if L is None:\n        L = []\n    L.append(a)\n    return L\n```\n\n### 4.9.2.Keyword ArgumentsÂ¶\n\nFunctions can also be called using keyword arguments of the form kwarg=value .  For instance, the following function:\n\n```python\ndef parrot(voltage, state='a stiff', action='voom', type='Norwegian Blue'):\n    print(\"-- This parrot wouldn't\", action, end=' ')\n    print(\"if you put\", voltage, \"volts through it.\")\n    print(\"-- Lovely plumage, the\", type)\n    print(\"-- It's\", state, \"!\")\n```\n\naccepts one required argument ( voltage ) and three optional arguments\n( state , action , and type ).  This function can be called in any\nof the following ways:\n\n```python\nparrot(1000)                                          # 1 positional argument\nparrot(voltage=1000)                                  # 1 keyword argument\nparrot(voltage=1000000, action='VOOOOOM')             # 2 keyword arguments\nparrot(action='VOOOOOM', voltage=1000000)             # 2 keyword arguments\nparrot('a million', 'bereft of life', 'jump')         # 3 positional arguments\nparrot('a thousand', state='pushing up the daisies')  # 1 positional, 1 keyword\n```\n\nbut all the following calls would be invalid:\n\n```python\nparrot()                     # required argument missing\nparrot(voltage=5.0, 'dead')  # non-keyword argument after a keyword argument\nparrot(110, voltage=220)     # duplicate value for the same argument\nparrot(actor='John Cleese')  # unknown keyword argument\n```\n\nIn a function call, keyword arguments must follow positional arguments.\nAll the keyword arguments passed must match one of the arguments\naccepted by the function (e.g. actor is not a valid argument for the parrot function), and their order is not important.  This also includes\nnon-optional arguments (e.g. parrot(voltage=1000) is valid too).\nNo argument may receive a value more than once.\nHereâs an example that fails due to this restriction:\n\n```python\n>>> def function(a):\n...     pass\n...\n>>> function(0, a=0)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: function() got multiple values for argument 'a'\n```\n\nWhen a final formal parameter of the form **name is present, it receives a\ndictionary (see Mapping Types â dict ) containing all keyword arguments except for\nthose corresponding to a formal parameter.  This may be combined with a formal\nparameter of the form *name (described in the next subsection) which\nreceives a tuple containing the positional\narguments beyond the formal parameter list.  ( *name must occur\nbefore **name .) For example, if we define a function like this:\n\n```python\ndef cheeseshop(kind, *arguments, **keywords):\n    print(\"-- Do you have any\", kind, \"?\")\n    print(\"-- I'm sorry, we're all out of\", kind)\n    for arg in arguments:\n        print(arg)\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    for kw in keywords:\n        print(kw, \":\", keywords[kw])\n```\n\nIt could be called like this:\n\n```python\ncheeseshop(\"Limburger\", \"It's very runny, sir.\",\n           \"It's really very, VERY runny, sir.\",\n           shopkeeper=\"Michael Palin\",\n           client=\"John Cleese\",\n           sketch=\"Cheese Shop Sketch\")\n```\n\nand of course it would print:\n\n```python\n-- Do you have any Limburger ?\n-- I'm sorry, we're all out of Limburger\nIt's very runny, sir.\nIt's really very, VERY runny, sir.\n----------------------------------------\nshopkeeper : Michael Palin\nclient : John Cleese\nsketch : Cheese Shop Sketch\n```\n\nNote that the order in which the keyword arguments are printed is guaranteed\nto match the order in which they were provided in the function call.\n\n### 4.9.3.Special parametersÂ¶\n\nBy default, arguments may be passed to a Python function either by position\nor explicitly by keyword. For readability and performance, it makes sense to\nrestrict the way arguments can be passed so that a developer need only look\nat the function definition to determine if items are passed by position, by\nposition or keyword, or by keyword.\n\nA function definition may look like:\n\n```python\ndef f(pos1, pos2, /, pos_or_kwd, *, kwd1, kwd2):\n      -----------    ----------     ----------\n        |             |                  |\n        |        Positional or keyword   |\n        |                                - Keyword only\n         -- Positional only\n```\n\nwhere / and * are optional. If used, these symbols indicate the kind of\nparameter by how the arguments may be passed to the function:\npositional-only, positional-or-keyword, and keyword-only. Keyword parameters\nare also referred to as named parameters.\n\n#### 4.9.3.1.Positional-or-Keyword ArgumentsÂ¶\n\nIf / and * are not present in the function definition, arguments may\nbe passed to a function by position or by keyword.\n\n#### 4.9.3.2.Positional-Only ParametersÂ¶\n\nLooking at this in a bit more detail, it is possible to mark certain parameters\nas positional-only . If positional-only , the parametersâ order matters, and\nthe parameters cannot be passed by keyword. Positional-only parameters are\nplaced before a / (forward-slash). The / is used to logically\nseparate the positional-only parameters from the rest of the parameters.\nIf there is no / in the function definition, there are no positional-only\nparameters.\n\nParameters following the / may be positional-or-keyword or keyword-only .\n\n#### 4.9.3.3.Keyword-Only ArgumentsÂ¶\n\nTo mark parameters as keyword-only , indicating the parameters must be passed\nby keyword argument, place an * in the arguments list just before the first keyword-only parameter.\n\n#### 4.9.3.4.Function ExamplesÂ¶\n\nConsider the following example function definitions paying close attention to the\nmarkers / and * :\n\n```python\n>>> def standard_arg(arg):\n...     print(arg)\n...\n>>> def pos_only_arg(arg, /):\n...     print(arg)\n...\n>>> def kwd_only_arg(*, arg):\n...     print(arg)\n...\n>>> def combined_example(pos_only, /, standard, *, kwd_only):\n...     print(pos_only, standard, kwd_only)\n```\n\nThe first function definition, standard_arg , the most familiar form,\nplaces no restrictions on the calling convention and arguments may be\npassed by position or keyword:\n\n```python\n>>> standard_arg(2)\n2\n\n>>> standard_arg(arg=2)\n2\n```\n\nThe second function pos_only_arg is restricted to only use positional\nparameters as there is a / in the function definition:\n\n```python\n>>> pos_only_arg(1)\n1\n\n>>> pos_only_arg(arg=1)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: pos_only_arg() got some positional-only arguments passed as keyword arguments: 'arg'\n```\n\nThe third function kwd_only_arg only allows keyword arguments as indicated\nby a * in the function definition:\n\n```python\n>>> kwd_only_arg(3)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: kwd_only_arg() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given\n\n>>> kwd_only_arg(arg=3)\n3\n```\n\nAnd the last uses all three calling conventions in the same function\ndefinition:\n\n```python\n>>> combined_example(1, 2, 3)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: combined_example() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given\n\n>>> combined_example(1, 2, kwd_only=3)\n1 2 3\n\n>>> combined_example(1, standard=2, kwd_only=3)\n1 2 3\n\n>>> combined_example(pos_only=1, standard=2, kwd_only=3)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: combined_example() got some positional-only arguments passed as keyword arguments: 'pos_only'\n```\n\nFinally, consider this function definition which has a potential collision between the positional argument name and **kwds which has name as a key:\n\n```python\ndef foo(name, **kwds):\n    return 'name' in kwds\n```\n\nThere is no possible call that will make it return True as the keyword 'name' will always bind to the first parameter. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> foo(1, **{'name': 2})\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: foo() got multiple values for argument 'name'\n>>>\n```\n\nBut using / (positional only arguments), it is possible since it allows name as a positional argument and 'name' as a key in the keyword arguments:\n\n```python\n>>> def foo(name, /, **kwds):\n...     return 'name' in kwds\n...\n>>> foo(1, **{'name': 2})\nTrue\n```\n\nIn other words, the names of positional-only parameters can be used in **kwds without ambiguity.\n\n#### 4.9.3.5.RecapÂ¶\n\nThe use case will determine which parameters to use in the function definition:\n\n```python\ndef f(pos1, pos2, /, pos_or_kwd, *, kwd1, kwd2):\n```\n\nAs guidance:\n\n- Use positional-only if you want the name of the parameters to not be\navailable to the user. This is useful when parameter names have no real\nmeaning, if you want to enforce the order of the arguments when the function\nis called or if you need to take some positional parameters and arbitrary\nkeywords.\n- Use keyword-only when names have meaning and the function definition is\nmore understandable by being explicit with names or you want to prevent\nusers relying on the position of the argument being passed.\n- For an API, use positional-only to prevent breaking API changes\nif the parameterâs name is modified in the future.\n\n### 4.9.4.Arbitrary Argument ListsÂ¶\n\nFinally, the least frequently used option is to specify that a function can be\ncalled with an arbitrary number of arguments.  These arguments will be wrapped\nup in a tuple (see Tuples and Sequences ).  Before the variable number of arguments,\nzero or more normal arguments may occur.\n\n```python\ndef write_multiple_items(file, separator, *args):\n    file.write(separator.join(args))\n```\n\nNormally, these variadic arguments will be last in the list of formal\nparameters, because they scoop up all remaining input arguments that are\npassed to the function. Any formal parameters which occur after the *args parameter are âkeyword-onlyâ arguments, meaning that they can only be used as\nkeywords rather than positional arguments.\n\n```python\n>>> def concat(*args, sep=\"/\"):\n...     return sep.join(args)\n...\n>>> concat(\"earth\", \"mars\", \"venus\")\n'earth/mars/venus'\n>>> concat(\"earth\", \"mars\", \"venus\", sep=\".\")\n'earth.mars.venus'\n```\n\n### 4.9.5.Unpacking Argument ListsÂ¶\n\nThe reverse situation occurs when the arguments are already in a list or tuple\nbut need to be unpacked for a function call requiring separate positional\narguments.  For instance, the built-in range() function expects separate start and stop arguments.  If they are not available separately, write the\nfunction call with the * -operator to unpack the arguments out of a list\nor tuple:\n\n```python\n>>> list(range(3, 6))            # normal call with separate arguments\n[3, 4, 5]\n>>> args = [3, 6]\n>>> list(range(*args))            # call with arguments unpacked from a list\n[3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nIn the same fashion, dictionaries can deliver keyword arguments with the ** -operator:\n\n```python\n>>> def parrot(voltage, state='a stiff', action='voom'):\n...     print(\"-- This parrot wouldn't\", action, end=' ')\n...     print(\"if you put\", voltage, \"volts through it.\", end=' ')\n...     print(\"E's\", state, \"!\")\n...\n>>> d = {\"voltage\": \"four million\", \"state\": \"bleedin' demised\", \"action\": \"VOOM\"}\n>>> parrot(**d)\n-- This parrot wouldn't VOOM if you put four million volts through it. E's bleedin' demised !\n```\n\n### 4.9.6.Lambda ExpressionsÂ¶\n\nSmall anonymous functions can be created with the lambda keyword.\nThis function returns the sum of its two arguments: lambda a, b: a+b .\nLambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required.  They are\nsyntactically restricted to a single expression.  Semantically, they are just\nsyntactic sugar for a normal function definition.  Like nested function\ndefinitions, lambda functions can reference variables from the containing\nscope:\n\n```python\n>>> def make_incrementor(n):\n...     return lambda x: x + n\n...\n>>> f = make_incrementor(42)\n>>> f(0)\n42\n>>> f(1)\n43\n```\n\nThe above example uses a lambda expression to return a function.  Another use\nis to pass a small function as an argument.  For instance, list.sort() takes a sorting key function key which can be a lambda function:\n\n```python\n>>> pairs = [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three'), (4, 'four')]\n>>> pairs.sort(key=lambda pair: pair[1])\n>>> pairs\n[(4, 'four'), (1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')]\n```\n\n### 4.9.7.Documentation StringsÂ¶\n\nHere are some conventions about the content and formatting of documentation\nstrings.\n\nThe first line should always be a short, concise summary of the objectâs\npurpose.  For brevity, it should not explicitly state the objectâs name or type,\nsince these are available by other means (except if the name happens to be a\nverb describing a functionâs operation).  This line should begin with a capital\nletter and end with a period.\n\nIf there are more lines in the documentation string, the second line should be\nblank, visually separating the summary from the rest of the description.  The\nfollowing lines should be one or more paragraphs describing the objectâs calling\nconventions, its side effects, etc.\n\nThe Python parser strips indentation from multi-line string literals when they\nserve as module, class, or function docstrings.\n\nHere is an example of a multi-line docstring:\n\n```python\n>>> def my_function():\n...     \"\"\"Do nothing, but document it.\n...\n...     No, really, it doesn't do anything:\n...\n...         >>> my_function()\n...         >>>\n...     \"\"\"\n...     pass\n...\n>>> print(my_function.__doc__)\nDo nothing, but document it.\n\nNo, really, it doesn't do anything:\n\n    >>> my_function()\n    >>>\n```\n\n### 4.9.8.Function AnnotationsÂ¶\n\nFunction annotations are completely optional metadata\ninformation about the types used by user-defined functions (see PEP 3107 and PEP 484 for more information).\n\nAnnotations are stored in the __annotations__ attribute of the function as a dictionary and have no effect on any other part of the\nfunction.  Parameter annotations are defined by a colon after the parameter name, followed\nby an expression evaluating to the value of the annotation.  Return annotations are\ndefined by a literal -> , followed by an expression, between the parameter\nlist and the colon denoting the end of the def statement.  The\nfollowing example has a required argument, an optional argument, and the return\nvalue annotated:\n\n```python\n>>> def f(ham: str, eggs: str = 'eggs') -> str:\n...     print(\"Annotations:\", f.__annotations__)\n...     print(\"Arguments:\", ham, eggs)\n...     return ham + ' and ' + eggs\n...\n>>> f('spam')\nAnnotations: {'ham': <class 'str'>, 'return': <class 'str'>, 'eggs': <class 'str'>}\nArguments: spam eggs\n'spam and eggs'\n```\n\n## 4.10.Intermezzo: Coding StyleÂ¶\n\nNow that you are about to write longer, more complex pieces of Python, it is a\ngood time to talk about coding style .  Most languages can be written (or more\nconcisely, formatted ) in different styles; some are more readable than others.\nMaking it easy for others to read your code is always a good idea, and adopting\na nice coding style helps tremendously for that.\n\nFor Python, PEP 8 has emerged as the style guide that most projects adhere to;\nit promotes a very readable and eye-pleasing coding style.  Every Python\ndeveloper should read it at some point; here are the most important points\nextracted for you:\n\n- Use 4-space indentation, and no tabs. 4 spaces are a good compromise between small indentation (allows greater\nnesting depth) and large indentation (easier to read).  Tabs introduce\nconfusion, and are best left out.\n- Wrap lines so that they donât exceed 79 characters. This helps users with small displays and makes it possible to have several\ncode files side-by-side on larger displays.\n- Use blank lines to separate functions and classes, and larger blocks of\ncode inside functions.\n- When possible, put comments on a line of their own.\n- Use docstrings.\n- Use spaces around operators and after commas, but not directly inside\nbracketing constructs: a = f(1, 2) + g(3, 4) .\n- Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use UpperCamelCase for classes and lowercase_with_underscores for functions\nand methods.  Always use self as the name for the first method argument\n(see A First Look at Classes for more on classes and methods).\n- Donât use fancy encodings if your code is meant to be used in international\nenvironments.  Pythonâs default, UTF-8, or even plain ASCII work best in any\ncase.\n- Likewise, donât use non-ASCII characters in identifiers if there is only the\nslightest chance people speaking a different language will read or maintain\nthe code.\n\nFootnotes",
