A string\nis a sequence , which means it is\nan ordered collection of other values. In this chapter you\u2019ll see\nhow to access the characters that make up a string, and you\u2019ll\nlearn about some of the methods strings provide. 8.1\u00a0\u00a0A string is a sequence A string is a sequence of characters.\nYou can access the characters one at a time with the\nbracket operator: >>> fruit = 'banana'\n>>> letter = fruit[1] The second statement selects character number 1 from fruit and assigns it to letter . The expression in brackets is called an index .\nThe index indicates which character in the sequence you\nwant (hence the name). But you might not get what you expect: >>> letter\n'a' For most people, the first letter of 'banana' is b , not a . But for computer scientists, the index is an offset from the\nbeginning of the string, and the offset of the first letter is zero. >>> letter = fruit[0]\n>>> letter\n'b' So b is the 0th letter (\u201czero-eth\u201d) of 'banana' , a is the 1th letter (\u201cone-eth\u201d), and n is the 2th letter\n(\u201ctwo-eth\u201d). As an index you can use an expression that contains variables and\noperators: >>> i = 1\n>>> fruit[i]\n'a'\n>>> fruit[i+1]\n'n' But the value of the index has to be an integer. Otherwise you\nget: >>> letter = fruit[1.5]\nTypeError: string indices must be integers 8.2 len len is a built-in function that returns the number of characters\nin a string: >>> fruit = 'banana'\n>>> len(fruit)\n6 To get the last letter of a string, you might be tempted to try something\nlike this: >>> length = len(fruit)\n>>> last = fruit[length]\nIndexError: string index out of range The reason for the IndexError is that there is no letter in \u2019banana\u2019 with the index 6. Since we started counting at zero, the\nsix letters are numbered 0 to 5. To get the last character, you have\nto subtract 1 from length : >>> last = fruit[length-1]\n>>> last\n'a' Or you can use negative indices, which count backward from\nthe end of the string. The expression fruit[-1] yields the last\nletter, fruit[-2] yields the second to last, and so on. 8.3\u00a0\u00a0Traversal with a for loop A lot of computations involve processing a string one character at a\ntime. Often they start at the beginning, select each character in\nturn, do something to it, and continue until the end. This pattern of\nprocessing is called a traversal . One way to write a traversal\nis with a while loop: index = 0\nwhile index < len(fruit):\n    letter = fruit[index]\n    print(letter)\n    index = index + 1 This loop traverses the string and displays each letter on a line by\nitself. The loop condition is index < len(fruit) , so\nwhen index is equal to the length of the string, the\ncondition is false, and the body of the loop doesn\u2019t run. The\nlast character accessed is the one with the index len(fruit)-1 ,\nwhich is the last character in the string. As an exercise, write a function that takes a string as an argument\nand displays the letters backward, one per line. Another way to write a traversal is with a for loop: for letter in fruit:\n    print(letter) Each time through the loop, the next character in the string is assigned\nto the variable letter . The loop continues until no characters are\nleft. The following example shows how to use concatenation (string addition)\nand a for loop to generate an abecedarian series (that is, in\nalphabetical order). In Robert McCloskey\u2019s book Make\nWay for Ducklings , the names of the ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack,\nMack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack. This loop outputs these names in\norder: prefixes = 'JKLMNOPQ'\nsuffix = 'ack'\n\nfor letter in prefixes:\n    print(letter + suffix) The output is: Jack\nKack\nLack\nMack\nNack\nOack\nPack\nQack Of course, that\u2019s not quite right because \u201cOuack\u201d and \u201cQuack\u201d are\nmisspelled. As an exercise, modify the program to fix this error. 8.4\u00a0\u00a0String slices A segment of a string is called a slice . Selecting a slice is\nsimilar to selecting a character: >>> s = 'Monty Python'\n>>> s[0:5]\n'Monty'\n>>> s[6:12]\n'Python' The operator [n:m] returns the part of the string from the\n\u201cn-eth\u201d character to the \u201cm-eth\u201d character, including the first but\nexcluding the last. This behavior is counterintuitive, but it might\nhelp to imagine the indices pointing between the\ncharacters, as in Figure 8.1 . Figure 8.1: Slice indices. If you omit the first index (before the colon), the slice starts at\nthe beginning of the string. If you omit the second index, the slice\ngoes to the end of the string: >>> fruit = 'banana'\n>>> fruit[:3]\n'ban'\n>>> fruit[3:]\n'ana' If the first index is greater than or equal to the second the result\nis an empty string , represented by two quotation marks: >>> fruit = 'banana'\n>>> fruit[3:3]\n'' An empty string contains no characters and has length 0, but other\nthan that, it is the same as any other string. Continuing this example, what do you think fruit[:] means? Try it and see. 8.5\u00a0\u00a0Strings are immutable It is tempting to use the [] operator on the left side of an\nassignment, with the intention of changing a character in a string.\nFor example: >>> greeting = 'Hello, world!'\n>>> greeting[0] = 'J'\nTypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment The \u201cobject\u201d in this case is the string and the \u201citem\u201d is\nthe character you tried to assign. For now, an object is\nthe same thing as a value, but we will refine that definition\nlater (Section 10.10 ). The reason for the error is that\nstrings are immutable , which means you can\u2019t change an\nexisting string. The best you can do is create a new string\nthat is a variation on the original: >>> greeting = 'Hello, world!'\n>>> new_greeting = 'J' + greeting[1:]\n>>> new_greeting\n'Jello, world!' This example concatenates a new first letter onto\na slice of greeting . It has no effect on\nthe original string. 8.6\u00a0\u00a0Searching What does the following function do? def find(word, letter):\n    index = 0\n    while index < len(word):\n        if word[index] == letter:\n            return index\n        index = index + 1\n    return -1 In a sense, find is the inverse of the [] operator.\nInstead of taking an index and extracting the corresponding character,\nit takes a character and finds the index where that character\nappears. If the character is not found, the function returns -1 . This is the first example we have seen of a return statement\ninside a loop. If word[index] == letter , the function breaks\nout of the loop and returns immediately. If the character doesn\u2019t appear in the string, the program\nexits the loop normally and returns -1 . This pattern of computation\u2014traversing a sequence and returning\nwhen we find what we are looking for\u2014is called a search . As an exercise, modify find so that it has a\nthird parameter, the index in word where it should start\nlooking. 8.7\u00a0\u00a0Looping and counting The following program counts the number of times the letter a appears in a string: word = 'banana'\ncount = 0\nfor letter in word:\n    if letter == 'a':\n        count = count + 1\nprint(count) This program demonstrates another pattern of computation called a counter . The variable count is initialized to 0 and then\nincremented each time an a is found.\nWhen the loop exits, count contains the result\u2014the total number of a \u2019s. As an exercise, encapsulate this code in a function named count , and generalize it so that it accepts the string and the\nletter as arguments. Then rewrite the function so that instead of\ntraversing the string, it uses the three-parameter version of find from the previous section. 8.8\u00a0\u00a0String methods Strings provide methods that perform a variety of useful operations.\nA method is similar to a function\u2014it takes arguments and\nreturns a value\u2014but the syntax is different. For example, the\nmethod upper takes a string and returns a new string with\nall uppercase letters. Instead of the function syntax upper(word) , it uses\nthe method syntax word.upper() . >>> word = 'banana'\n>>> new_word = word.upper()\n>>> new_word\n'BANANA' This form of dot notation specifies the name of the method, upper , and the name of the string to apply the method to, word . The empty parentheses indicate that this method takes no\narguments. A method call is called an invocation ; in this case, we would\nsay that we are invoking upper on word . As it turns out, there is a string method named find that\nis remarkably similar to the function we wrote: >>> word = 'banana'\n>>> index = word.find('a')\n>>> index\n1 In this example, we invoke find on word and pass\nthe letter we are looking for as a parameter. Actually, the find method is more general than our function;\nit can find substrings, not just characters: >>> word.find('na')\n2 By default, find starts at the beginning of the string, but\nit can take a second argument, the index where it should start: >>> word.find('na', 3)\n4 This is an example of an optional argument ; find can\nalso take a third argument, the index where it should stop: >>> name = 'bob'\n>>> name.find('b', 1, 2)\n-1 This search fails because b does not\nappear in the index range from 1 to 2 , not including 2 . Searching up to, but not including, the second index makes find consistent with the slice operator. 8.9\u00a0\u00a0The in operator The word in is a boolean operator that takes two strings and\nreturns True if the first appears as a substring in the second: >>> 'a' in 'banana'\nTrue\n>>> 'seed' in 'banana'\nFalse For example, the following function prints all the\nletters from word1 that also appear in word2 : def in_both(word1, word2):\n    for letter in word1:\n        if letter in word2:\n            print(letter) With well-chosen variable names,\nPython sometimes reads like English. You could read\nthis loop, \u201cfor (each) letter in (the first) word, if (the) letter\n(appears) in (the second) word, print (the) letter.\u201d Here\u2019s what you get if you compare apples and oranges: >>> in_both('apples', 'oranges')\na\ne\ns 8.10\u00a0\u00a0String comparison The relational operators work on strings. To see if two strings are equal: if word == 'banana':\n    print('All right, bananas.') Other relational operations are useful for putting words in alphabetical\norder: if word < 'banana':\n    print('Your word, ' + word + ', comes before banana.')\nelif word > 'banana':\n    print('Your word, ' + word + ', comes after banana.')\nelse:\n    print('All right, bananas.') Python does not handle uppercase and lowercase letters the same way\npeople do. All the uppercase letters come before all the\nlowercase letters, so: Your word, Pineapple, comes before banana. A common way to address this problem is to convert strings to a\nstandard format, such as all lowercase, before performing the\ncomparison. Keep that in mind in case you have to defend yourself\nagainst a man armed with a Pineapple. 8.11\u00a0\u00a0Debugging When you use indices to traverse the values in a sequence,\nit is tricky to get the beginning and end of the traversal\nright. Here is a function that is supposed to compare two\nwords and return True if one of the words is the reverse\nof the other, but it contains two errors: def is_reverse(word1, word2):\n    if len(word1) != len(word2):\n        return False\n\n    i = 0\n    j = len(word2)\n\n    while j > 0:\n        if word1[i] != word2[j]:\n            return False\n        i = i+1\n        j = j-1\n\n    return True The first if statement checks whether the words are the\nsame length. If not, we can return False immediately.\nOtherwise, for the rest of the function, we can assume that the words\nare the same length. This is an example of the guardian pattern\nin Section 6.8 . i and j are indices: i traverses word1 forward while j traverses word2 backward. If we find\ntwo letters that don\u2019t match, we can return False immediately.\nIf we get through the whole loop and all the letters match, we\nreturn True . If we test this function with the words \u201cpots\u201d and \u201cstop\u201d, we\nexpect the return value True , but we get an IndexError: >>> is_reverse('pots', 'stop')\n...\n  File \"reverse.py\", line 15, in is_reverse\n    if word1[i] != word2[j]:\nIndexError: string index out of range For debugging this kind of error, my first move is to\nprint the values of the indices immediately before the line\nwhere the error appears. while j > 0:\n        print(i, j)        # print here\n\n        if word1[i] != word2[j]:\n            return False\n        i = i+1\n        j = j-1 Now when I run the program again, I get more information: >>> is_reverse('pots', 'stop')\n0 4\n...\nIndexError: string index out of range The first time through the loop, the value of j is 4,\nwhich is out of range for the string 'pots' .\nThe index of the last character is 3, so the\ninitial value for j should be len(word2)-1 . If I fix that error and run the program again, I get: >>> is_reverse('pots', 'stop')\n0 3\n1 2\n2 1\nTrue This time we get the right answer, but it looks like the loop only ran\nthree times, which is suspicious. To get a better idea of what is\nhappening, it is useful to draw a state diagram. During the first\niteration, the frame for is_reverse is shown in\nFigure 8.2 . Figure 8.2: State diagram. I took some license by arranging the variables in the frame\nand adding dotted lines to show that the values of i and j indicate characters in word1 and word2 . Starting with this diagram, run the program on paper, changing the\nvalues of i and j during each iteration. Find and fix the\nsecond error in this function. 8.12\u00a0\u00a0Glossary object: Something a variable can refer to. For now,\nyou can use \u201cobject\u201d and \u201cvalue\u201d interchangeably. sequence: An ordered collection of\nvalues where each value is identified by an integer index. item: One of the values in a sequence. index: An integer value used to select an item in\na sequence, such as a character in a string. In Python\nindices start from 0. slice: A part of a string specified by a range of indices. empty string: A string with no characters and length 0, represented\nby two quotation marks. immutable: The property of a sequence whose items cannot\nbe changed. traverse: To iterate through the items in a sequence,\nperforming a similar operation on each. search: A pattern of traversal that stops\nwhen it finds what it is looking for. counter: A variable used to count something, usually initialized\nto zero and then incremented. invocation: A statement that calls a method. optional argument: A function or method argument that is not\nrequired. 8.13\u00a0\u00a0Exercises Exercise\u00a01 Read the documentation of the string methods at http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods .\nYou might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you\nunderstand how they work. strip and replace are\nparticularly useful. The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing.\nFor example, in find(sub[, start[, end]]) , the brackets\nindicate optional arguments. So sub is required, but start is optional, and if you include start ,\nthen end is optional. Exercise\u00a02 There is a string method called count that is similar\nto the function in Section 8.7 . Read the documentation\nof this method\nand write an invocation that counts the number of a \u2019s\nin 'banana' . Exercise\u00a03 A string slice can take a third index that specifies the \u201cstep\nsize\u201d; that is, the number of spaces between successive characters.\nA step size of 2 means every other character; 3 means every third,\netc. >>> fruit = 'banana'\n>>> fruit[0:5:2]\n'bnn' A step size of -1 goes through the word backwards, so\nthe slice [::-1] generates a reversed string. Use this idiom to write a one-line version of is_palindrome from Exercise 3 . Exercise\u00a04 The following functions are all intended to check whether a\nstring contains any lowercase letters, but at least some of them are\nwrong. For each function, describe what the function actually does\n(assuming that the parameter is a string). def any_lowercase1(s):\n    for c in s:\n        if c.islower():\n            return True\n        else:\n            return False\n\ndef any_lowercase2(s):\n    for c in s:\n        if 'c'.islower():\n            return 'True'\n        else:\n            return 'False'\n\ndef any_lowercase3(s):\n    for c in s:\n        flag = c.islower()\n    return flag\n\ndef any_lowercase4(s):\n    flag = False\n    for c in s:\n        flag = flag or c.islower()\n    return flag\n\ndef any_lowercase5(s):\n    for c in s:\n        if not c.islower():\n            return False\n    return True Exercise\u00a05 A Caesar cypher is a weak form of encryption that involves \u201crotating\u201d each\nletter by a fixed number of places. To rotate a letter means\nto shift it through the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning if\nnecessary, so \u2019A\u2019 rotated by 3 is \u2019D\u2019 and \u2019Z\u2019 rotated by 1 is \u2019A\u2019. To rotate a word, rotate each letter by the same amount.\nFor example, \u201ccheer\u201d rotated by 7 is \u201cjolly\u201d and \u201cmelon\u201d rotated\nby -10 is \u201ccubed\u201d. In the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey , the\nship computer is called HAL, which is IBM rotated by -1. Write a function called rotate_word that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and returns\na new string that contains the letters from the original string\nrotated by the given amount. You might want to use the built-in function ord , which converts\na character to a numeric code, and chr , which converts numeric\ncodes to characters. Letters of the alphabet are encoded in alphabetical\norder, so for example: >>> ord('c') - ord('a')\n2 Because 'c' is the two-eth letter of the alphabet. But\nbeware: the numeric codes for upper case letters are different. Potentially offensive jokes on the Internet are sometimes encoded in\nROT13, which is a Caesar cypher with rotation 13. If you are not\neasily offended, find and decode some of them. Solution: https://thinkpython.com/code/rotate.py .
