When you define a function,\nyou specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later, you can\n\u201ccall\u201d the function by name. 3.1\u00a0\u00a0Function calls We have already seen one example of a function call : >>> type(42)\n<class 'int'> The name of the function is type . The expression in parentheses\nis called the argument of the function. The result, for this\nfunction, is the type of the argument. It is common to say that a function \u201ctakes\u201d an argument and \u201creturns\u201d\na result. The result is also called the return value . Python provides functions that convert values\nfrom one type to another. The int function takes any value and\nconverts it to an integer, if it can, or complains otherwise: >>> int('32')\n32\n>>> int('Hello')\nValueError: invalid literal for int(): Hello int can convert floating-point values to integers, but it\ndoesn\u2019t round off; it chops off the fraction part: >>> int(3.99999)\n3\n>>> int(-2.3)\n-2 float converts integers and strings to floating-point\nnumbers: >>> float(32)\n32.0\n>>> float('3.14159')\n3.14159 Finally, str converts its argument to a string: >>> str(32)\n'32'\n>>> str(3.14159)\n'3.14159' 3.2\u00a0\u00a0Math functions Python has a math module that provides most of the familiar\nmathematical functions. A module is a file that contains a\ncollection of related functions. Before we can use the functions in a module, we have to import it with\nan import statement : >>> import math This statement creates a module object named math. If\nyou display the module object, you get some information about it: >>> math\n<module 'math' (built-in)> The module object contains the functions and variables defined in the\nmodule. To access one of the functions, you have to specify the name\nof the module and the name of the function, separated by a dot (also\nknown as a period). This format is called dot notation . >>> ratio = signal_power / noise_power\n>>> decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)\n\n>>> radians = 0.7\n>>> height = math.sin(radians) The first example uses math.log10 to compute\na signal-to-noise ratio in decibels (assuming that signal_power and noise_power are defined). The math module also provides log ,\nwhich computes logarithms base e . The second example finds the sine of radians . The variable name radians is a hint that sin and the other trigonometric\nfunctions ( cos , tan , etc.) take arguments in radians. To\nconvert from degrees to radians, divide by 180 and multiply by\n\u03c0: >>> degrees = 45\n>>> radians = degrees / 180.0 * math.pi\n>>> math.sin(radians)\n0.707106781187 The expression math.pi gets the variable pi from the math\nmodule. Its value is a floating-point approximation\nof \u03c0, accurate to about 15 digits. If you know\ntrigonometry, you can check the previous result by comparing it to\nthe square root of two, divided by two: >>> math.sqrt(2) / 2.0\n0.707106781187 3.3\u00a0\u00a0Composition So far, we have looked at the elements of a program\u2014variables,\nexpressions, and statements\u2014in isolation, without talking about how to\ncombine them. One of the most useful features of programming languages is their\nability to take small building blocks and compose them. For\nexample, the argument of a function can be any kind of expression,\nincluding arithmetic operators: x = math.sin(degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi) And even function calls: x = math.exp(math.log(x+1)) Almost anywhere you can put a value, you can put an arbitrary\nexpression, with one exception: the left side of an assignment\nstatement has to be a variable name. Any other expression on the left\nside is a syntax error (we will see exceptions to this rule\nlater). >>> minutes = hours * 60                 # right\n>>> hours * 60 = minutes                 # wrong!\nSyntaxError: can't assign to operator 3.4\u00a0\u00a0Adding new functions So far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python,\nbut it is also possible to add new functions.\nA function definition specifies the name of a new function and\nthe sequence of statements that run when the function is called. Here is an example: def print_lyrics():\n    print(\"I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\")\n    print(\"I sleep all night and I work all day.\") def is a keyword that indicates that this is a function\ndefinition. The name of the function is print_lyrics . The\nrules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters,\nnumbers and underscore are legal, but the first character\ncan\u2019t be a number. You can\u2019t use a keyword as the name of a function,\nand you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same\nname. The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function\ndoesn\u2019t take any arguments. The first line of the function definition is called the header ;\nthe rest is called the body . The header has to end with a colon\nand the body has to be indented. By convention, indentation is\nalways four spaces. The body can contain\nany number of statements. The strings in the print statements are enclosed in double\nquotes. Single quotes and double quotes do the same thing;\nmost people use single quotes except in cases like this where\na single quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the string. All quotation marks (single and double)\nmust be \u201cstraight quotes\u201d, usually\nlocated next to Enter on the keyboard. \u201cCurly quotes\u201d, like\nthe ones in this sentence, are not legal in Python. If you type a function definition in interactive mode, the interpreter\nprints dots ( ... ) to let you know that the definition\nisn\u2019t complete: >>> def print_lyrics():\n...     print(\"I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\")\n...     print(\"I sleep all night and I work all day.\")\n... To end the function, you have to enter an empty line. Defining a function creates a function object , which\nhas type function : >>> print(print_lyrics)\n<function print_lyrics at 0xb7e99e9c>\n>>> type(print_lyrics)\n<class 'function'> The syntax for calling the new function is the same as\nfor built-in functions: >>> print_lyrics()\nI'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\nI sleep all night and I work all day. Once you have defined a function, you can use it inside another\nfunction. For example, to repeat the previous refrain, we could write\na function called repeat_lyrics : def repeat_lyrics():\n    print_lyrics()\n    print_lyrics() And then call repeat_lyrics : >>> repeat_lyrics()\nI'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\nI sleep all night and I work all day.\nI'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\nI sleep all night and I work all day. But that\u2019s not really how the song goes. 3.5\u00a0\u00a0Definitions and uses Pulling together the code fragments from the previous section, the\nwhole program looks like this: def print_lyrics():\n    print(\"I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.\")\n    print(\"I sleep all night and I work all day.\")\n\ndef repeat_lyrics():\n    print_lyrics()\n    print_lyrics()\n\nrepeat_lyrics() This program contains two function definitions: print_lyrics and repeat_lyrics . Function definitions get executed just like other\nstatements, but the effect is to create function objects. The statements\ninside the function do not run until the function is called, and\nthe function definition generates no output. As you might expect, you have to create a function before you can\nrun it. In other words, the function definition has to run\nbefore the function gets called. As an exercise, move the last line of this program\nto the top, so the function call appears before the definitions. Run\nthe program and see what error\nmessage you get. Now move the function call back to the bottom\nand move the definition of print_lyrics after the definition of repeat_lyrics . What happens when you run this program? 3.6\u00a0\u00a0Flow of execution To ensure that a function is defined before its first use,\nyou have to know the order statements run in, which is\ncalled the flow of execution . Execution always begins at the first statement of the program.\nStatements are run one at a time, in order from top to bottom. Function definitions do not alter the flow of execution of the\nprogram, but remember that statements inside the function don\u2019t\nrun until the function is called. A function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of\ngoing to the next statement, the flow jumps to the body of\nthe function, runs the statements there, and then comes back\nto pick up where it left off. That sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can\ncall another. While in the middle of one function, the program might\nhave to run the statements in another function. Then, while\nrunning that new function, the program might have to run yet\nanother function! Fortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each\ntime a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in\nthe function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program,\nit terminates. In summary, when you read a program, you\ndon\u2019t always want to read from top to bottom. Sometimes it makes\nmore sense if you follow the flow of execution. 3.7\u00a0\u00a0Parameters and arguments Some of the functions we have seen require arguments. For\nexample, when you call math.sin you pass a number\nas an argument. Some functions take more than one argument: math.pow takes two, the base and the exponent. Inside the function, the arguments are assigned to\nvariables called parameters . Here is a definition for\na function that takes an argument: def print_twice(bruce):\n    print(bruce)\n    print(bruce) This function assigns the argument to a parameter\nnamed bruce . When the function is called, it prints the value of\nthe parameter (whatever it is) twice. This function works with any value that can be printed. >>> print_twice('Spam')\nSpam\nSpam\n>>> print_twice(42)\n42\n42\n>>> print_twice(math.pi)\n3.14159265359\n3.14159265359 The same rules of composition that apply to built-in functions also\napply to programmer-defined functions, so we can use any kind of expression\nas an argument for print_twice : >>> print_twice('Spam '*4)\nSpam Spam Spam Spam\nSpam Spam Spam Spam\n>>> print_twice(math.cos(math.pi))\n-1.0\n-1.0 The argument is evaluated before the function is called, so\nin the examples the expressions 'Spam '*4 and math.cos(math.pi) are only evaluated once. You can also use a variable as an argument: >>> michael = 'Eric, the half a bee.'\n>>> print_twice(michael)\nEric, the half a bee.\nEric, the half a bee. The name of the variable we pass as an argument ( michael ) has\nnothing to do with the name of the parameter ( bruce ). It\ndoesn\u2019t matter what the value was called back home (in the caller);\nhere in print_twice , we call everybody bruce . 3.8\u00a0\u00a0Variables and parameters are local When you create a variable inside a function, it is local ,\nwhich means that it only\nexists inside the function. For example: def cat_twice(part1, part2):\n    cat = part1 + part2\n    print_twice(cat) This function takes two arguments, concatenates them, and prints\nthe result twice. Here is an example that uses it: >>> line1 = 'Bing tiddle '\n>>> line2 = 'tiddle bang.'\n>>> cat_twice(line1, line2)\nBing tiddle tiddle bang.\nBing tiddle tiddle bang. When cat_twice terminates, the variable cat is destroyed. If we try to print it, we get an exception: >>> print(cat)\nNameError: name 'cat' is not defined Parameters are also local.\nFor example, outside print_twice , there is no\nsuch thing as bruce . 3.9\u00a0\u00a0Stack diagrams To keep track of which variables can be used where, it is sometimes\nuseful to draw a stack diagram . Like state diagrams, stack\ndiagrams show the value of each variable, but they also show the\nfunction each variable belongs to. Each function is represented by a frame . A frame is a box with\nthe name of a function beside it and the parameters and variables of\nthe function inside it. The stack diagram for the previous example is\nshown in Figure 3.1 . Figure 3.1: Stack diagram. The frames are arranged in a stack that indicates which function\ncalled which, and so on. In this example, print_twice was called by cat_twice , and cat_twice was called by __main__ , which is a special name for the topmost frame. When\nyou create a variable outside of any function, it belongs to __main__ . Each parameter refers to the same value as its corresponding\nargument. So, part1 has the same value as line1 , part2 has the same value as line2 ,\nand bruce has the same value as cat . If an error occurs during a function call, Python prints the\nname of the function, the name of the function that called\nit, and the name of the function that called that , all the\nway back to __main__ . For example, if you try to access cat from within print_twice , you get a NameError : Traceback (innermost last):\n  File \"test.py\", line 13, in __main__\n    cat_twice(line1, line2)\n  File \"test.py\", line 5, in cat_twice\n    print_twice(cat)\n  File \"test.py\", line 9, in print_twice\n    print(cat)\nNameError: name 'cat' is not defined This list of functions is called a traceback . It tells you what\nprogram file the error occurred in, and what line, and what functions\nwere executing at the time. It also shows the line of code that\ncaused the error. The order of the functions in the traceback is the same as the\norder of the frames in the stack diagram. The function that is\ncurrently running is at the bottom. 3.10\u00a0\u00a0Fruitful functions and void functions Some of the functions we have used, such as the math functions, return\nresults; for lack of a better name, I call them fruitful\nfunctions . Other functions, like print_twice , perform an\naction but don\u2019t return a value. They are called void\nfunctions . When you call a fruitful function, you almost always\nwant to do something with the result; for example, you might\nassign it to a variable or use it as part of an expression: x = math.cos(radians)\ngolden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2 When you call a function in interactive mode, Python displays\nthe result: >>> math.sqrt(5)\n2.2360679774997898 But in a script, if you call a fruitful function all by itself,\nthe return value is lost forever! math.sqrt(5) This script computes the square root of 5, but since it doesn\u2019t store\nor display the result, it is not very useful. Void functions might display something on the screen or have some\nother effect, but they don\u2019t have a return value. If you\nassign the result to a variable, you get a special value called None . >>> result = print_twice('Bing')\nBing\nBing\n>>> print(result)\nNone The value None is not the same as the string 'None' .\nIt is a special value that has its own type: >>> type(None)\n<class 'NoneType'> The functions we have written so far are all void. We will start\nwriting fruitful functions in a few chapters. 3.11\u00a0\u00a0Why functions? It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide\na program into functions. There are several reasons: Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group\nof statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug. Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive\ncode. Later, if you make a change, you only have\nto make it in one place. Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the\nparts one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole. Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs.\nOnce you write and debug one, you can reuse it. 3.12\u00a0\u00a0Debugging One of the most important skills you will acquire is debugging.\nAlthough it can be frustrating, debugging is one of the most\nintellectually rich, challenging, and interesting parts of\nprogramming. In some ways debugging is like detective work. You are confronted\nwith clues and you have to infer the processes and events that led\nto the results you see. Debugging is also like an experimental science. Once you have an idea\nabout what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again. If\nyour hypothesis was correct, you can predict the result of the\nmodification, and you take a step closer to a working program. If\nyour hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one. As\nSherlock Holmes pointed out, \u201cWhen you have eliminated the\nimpossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.\u201d\n(A. Conan Doyle, The Sign of Four ) For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That\nis, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until\nit does what you want. The idea is that you should start with a\nworking program and make small modifications,\ndebugging them as you go. For example, Linux is an operating system that contains millions of\nlines of code, but it started out as a simple program Linus Torvalds\nused to explore the Intel 80386 chip. According to Larry Greenfield,\n\u201cOne of Linus\u2019s earlier projects was a program that would switch\nbetween printing AAAA and BBBB. This later evolved to Linux.\u201d\n( The Linux Users\u2019 Guide Beta Version 1). 3.13\u00a0\u00a0Glossary function: A named sequence of statements that performs some\nuseful operation. Functions may or may not take arguments and may or\nmay not produce a result. function definition: A statement that creates a new function,\nspecifying its name, parameters, and the statements it contains. function object: A value created by a function definition.\nThe name of the function is a variable that refers to a function\nobject. header: The first line of a function definition. body: The sequence of statements inside a function definition. parameter: A name used inside a function to refer to the value\npassed as an argument. function call: A statement that runs a function. It\nconsists of the function name followed by an argument list in\nparentheses. argument: A value provided to a function when the function is called.\nThis value is assigned to the corresponding parameter in the function. local variable: A variable defined inside a function. A local\nvariable can only be used inside its function. return value: The result of a function. If a function call\nis used as an expression, the return value is the value of\nthe expression. fruitful function: A function that returns a value. void function: A function that always returns None . None : A special value returned by void functions. module: A file that contains a\ncollection of related functions and other definitions. import statement: A statement that reads a module file and creates\na module object. module object: A value created by an import statement\nthat provides access to the values defined in a module. dot notation: The syntax for calling a function in another\nmodule by specifying the module name followed by a dot (period) and\nthe function name. composition: Using an expression as part of a larger expression,\nor a statement as part of a larger statement. flow of execution: The order statements run in. stack diagram: A graphical representation of a stack of functions,\ntheir variables, and the values they refer to. frame: A box in a stack diagram that represents a function call.\nIt contains the local variables and parameters of the function. traceback: A list of the functions that are executing,\nprinted when an exception occurs. 3.14\u00a0\u00a0Exercises Exercise\u00a01 Write a function named right_justify that takes a string\nnamed s as a parameter and prints the string with enough\nleading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70\nof the display. >>> right_justify('monty')\n                                                                 monty Hint: Use string concatenation and repetition. Also,\nPython provides a built-in function called len that\nreturns the length of a string, so the value of len('monty') is 5. Exercise\u00a02 A function object is a value you can assign to a variable\nor pass as an argument. For example, do_twice is a function\nthat takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice: def do_twice(f):\n    f()\n    f() Here\u2019s an example that uses do_twice to call a function\nnamed print_spam twice. def print_spam():\n    print('spam')\n\ndo_twice(print_spam) Type this example into a script and test it. Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments, a\nfunction object and a value, and calls the function twice,\npassing the value as an argument. Copy the definition of print_twice from earlier in this chapter to your script. Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice, passing 'spam' as an argument. Define a new function called do_four that takes a function object and a value\nand calls the function four times, passing the value\nas a parameter. There should be only\ntwo statements in the body of this function, not four. Solution: https://thinkpython.com/code/do_four.py . Exercise\u00a03 Note: This exercise should be\ndone using only the statements and other features we have learned so\nfar. Write a function that draws a grid like the following: + - - - - + - - - - +\n|         |         |\n|         |         |\n|         |         |\n|         |         |\n+ - - - - + - - - - +\n|         |         |\n|         |         |\n|         |         |\n|         |         |\n+ - - - - + - - - - + Hint: to print more than one value on a line, you can print\na comma-separated sequence of values: print('+', '-') By default, print advances to the next line, but you\ncan override that behavior and put a space at the end, like this: print('+', end=' ')\nprint('-') The output of these statements is '+ -' on the same line.\nThe output from the next print statement would begin on the next line. Write a function that draws a similar grid\nwith four rows and four columns.
