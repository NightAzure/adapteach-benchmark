We saw a kind of iteration,\nusing recursion, in Section 5.8 .\nWe saw another kind, using a for loop,\nin Section 4.2 . In this chapter we\u2019ll see yet another\nkind, using a while statement.\nBut first I want to say a little more about variable assignment. 7.1\u00a0\u00a0Reassignment As you may have discovered, it is legal to make more than one\nassignment to the same variable. A new assignment makes an existing\nvariable refer to a new value (and stop referring to the old value). >>> x = 5\n>>> x\n5\n>>> x = 7\n>>> x\n7 The first time we display x , its value is 5; the second time, its\nvalue is 7. Figure 7.1 shows what reassignment looks\nlike in a state diagram. At this point I want to address a common source of\nconfusion.\nBecause Python uses the equal sign ( = ) for assignment, it is\ntempting to interpret a statement like a = b as a\nmathematical\nproposition of equality; that is, the claim that a and b are equal. But this interpretation is wrong. First, equality is a symmetric relationship and assignment is not. For\nexample, in mathematics, if a =7 then 7= a . But in Python, the\nstatement a = 7 is legal and 7 = a is not. Also, in mathematics, a proposition of equality is either true or\nfalse for all time. If a = b now, then a will always equal b .\nIn Python, an assignment statement can make two variables equal, but\nthey don\u2019t have to stay that way: >>> a = 5\n>>> b = a    # a and b are now equal\n>>> a = 3    # a and b are no longer equal\n>>> b\n5 The third line changes the value of a but does not change the\nvalue of b , so they are no longer equal. Reassigning variables is often useful, but you should use it\nwith caution. If the values of variables change frequently, it can\nmake the code difficult to read and debug. Figure 7.1: State diagram. 7.2\u00a0\u00a0Updating variables A common kind of reassignment is an update ,\nwhere the new value of the variable depends on the old. >>> x = x + 1 This means \u201cget the current value of x , add one, and then\nupdate x with the new value.\u201d If you try to update a variable that doesn\u2019t exist, you get an\nerror, because Python evaluates the right side before it assigns\na value to x : >>> x = x + 1\nNameError: name 'x' is not defined Before you can update a variable, you have to initialize it, usually with a simple assignment: >>> x = 0\n>>> x = x + 1 Updating a variable by adding 1 is called an increment ;\nsubtracting 1 is called a decrement . 7.3\u00a0\u00a0The while statement Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating\nidentical or similar tasks without making errors is something that\ncomputers do well and people do poorly. In a computer program,\nrepetition is also called iteration . We have already seen two functions, countdown and print_n , that iterate using recursion. Because iteration is so\ncommon, Python provides language features to make it easier.\nOne is the for statement we saw in Section 4.2 .\nWe\u2019ll get back to that later. Another is the while statement. Here is a version of countdown that uses a while statement: def countdown(n):\n    while n > 0:\n        print(n)\n        n = n - 1\n    print('Blastoff!') You can almost read the while statement as if it were English.\nIt means, \u201cWhile n is greater than 0,\ndisplay the value of n and then decrement n . When you get to 0, display the word Blastoff! \u201d More formally, here is the flow of execution for a while statement: Determine whether the condition is true or false. If false, exit the while statement\nand continue execution at the next statement. If the condition is true, run the\nbody and then go back to step 1. This type of flow is called a loop because the third step\nloops back around to the top. The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables\nso that the condition becomes false eventually and the loop\nterminates. Otherwise the loop will repeat forever, which is called\nan infinite loop . An endless source of amusement for computer\nscientists is the observation that the directions on shampoo,\n\u201cLather, rinse, repeat\u201d, are an infinite loop. In the case of countdown , we can prove that the loop\nterminates: if n is zero or negative, the loop never runs.\nOtherwise, n gets smaller each time through the\nloop, so eventually we have to get to 0. For some other loops, it is not so easy to tell. For example: def sequence(n):\n    while n != 1:\n        print(n)\n        if n % 2 == 0:        # n is even\n            n = n / 2\n        else:                 # n is odd\n            n = n*3 + 1 The condition for this loop is n != 1 , so the loop will continue\nuntil n is 1 , which makes the condition false. Each time through the loop, the program outputs the value of n and then checks whether it is even or odd. If it is even, n is\ndivided by 2. If it is odd, the value of n is replaced with n*3 + 1 . For example, if the argument passed to sequence is 3, the resulting values of n are 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. Since n sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no\nobvious proof that n will ever reach 1, or that the program\nterminates. For some particular values of n , we can prove\ntermination. For example, if the starting value is a power of two, n will be even every time through the loop\nuntil it reaches 1. The previous example ends with such a sequence,\nstarting with 16. The hard question is whether we can prove that this program terminates\nfor all positive values of n . So far, no one has\nbeen able to prove it or disprove it! (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture .) As an exercise, rewrite the function print_n from\nSection 5.8 using iteration instead of recursion. 7.4 break Sometimes you don\u2019t know it\u2019s time to end a loop until you get half\nway through the body. In that case you can use the break statement to jump out of the loop. For example, suppose you want to take input from the user until they\ntype done . You could write: while True:\n    line = input('> ')\n    if line == 'done':\n        break\n    print(line)\n\nprint('Done!') The loop condition is True , which is always true, so the\nloop runs until it hits the break statement. Each time through, it prompts the user with an angle bracket.\nIf the user types done , the break statement exits\nthe loop. Otherwise the program echoes whatever the user types\nand goes back to the top of the loop. Here\u2019s a sample run: > not done\nnot done\n> done\nDone! This way of writing while loops is common because you\ncan check the condition anywhere in the loop (not just at the\ntop) and you can express the stop condition affirmatively\n(\u201cstop when this happens\u201d) rather than negatively (\u201ckeep going\nuntil that happens\u201d). 7.5\u00a0\u00a0Square roots Loops are often used in programs that compute\nnumerical results by starting with an approximate answer and\niteratively improving it. For example, one way of computing square roots is Newton\u2019s method.\nSuppose that you want to know the square root of a . If you start\nwith almost any estimate, x , you can compute a better\nestimate with the following formula: y = x + a / x 2 For example, if a is 4 and x is 3: >>> a = 4\n>>> x = 3\n>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2\n>>> y\n2.16666666667 The result is closer to the correct answer (\u221a 4 = 2). If we\nrepeat the process with the new estimate, it gets even closer: >>> x = y\n>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2\n>>> y\n2.00641025641 After a few more updates, the estimate is almost exact: >>> x = y\n>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2\n>>> y\n2.00001024003\n>>> x = y\n>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2\n>>> y\n2.00000000003 In general we don\u2019t know ahead of time how many steps it takes\nto get to the right answer, but we know when we get there\nbecause the estimate\nstops changing: >>> x = y\n>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2\n>>> y\n2.0\n>>> x = y\n>>> y = (x + a/x) / 2\n>>> y\n2.0 When y == x , we can stop. Here is a loop that starts\nwith an initial estimate, x , and improves it until it\nstops changing: while True:\n    print(x)\n    y = (x + a/x) / 2\n    if y == x:\n        break\n    x = y For most values of a this works fine, but in general it is\ndangerous to test float equality.\nFloating-point values are only approximately right:\nmost rational numbers, like 1/3, and irrational numbers, like\n\u221a 2 , can\u2019t be represented exactly with a float . Rather than checking whether x and y are exactly equal, it\nis safer to use the built-in function abs to compute the\nabsolute value, or magnitude, of the difference between them: if abs(y-x) < epsilon:\n        break Where epsilon has a value like 0.0000001 that\ndetermines how close is close enough. 7.6\u00a0\u00a0Algorithms Newton\u2019s method is an example of an algorithm : it is a\nmechanical process for solving a category of problems (in this\ncase, computing square roots). To understand what an algorithm is, it might help to start with\nsomething that is not an algorithm. When you learned to multiply\nsingle-digit numbers, you probably memorized the multiplication table.\nIn effect, you memorized 100 specific solutions. That kind of\nknowledge is not algorithmic. But if you were \u201clazy\u201d, you might have learned a few\ntricks. For example, to find the product of n and 9, you can\nwrite n \u22121 as the first digit and 10\u2212 n as the second\ndigit. This trick is a general solution for multiplying any\nsingle-digit number by 9. That\u2019s an algorithm! Similarly, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying,\nsubtraction with borrowing, and long division are all algorithms. One\nof the characteristics of algorithms is that they do not require any\nintelligence to carry out. They are mechanical processes where\neach step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules. Executing algorithms is boring, but designing them is interesting,\nintellectually challenging, and a central part of computer science. Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty or\nconscious thought, are the hardest to express algorithmically.\nUnderstanding natural language is a good example. We all do it, but\nso far no one has been able to explain how we do it, at least\nnot in the form of an algorithm. 7.7\u00a0\u00a0Debugging As you start writing bigger programs, you might find yourself\nspending more time debugging. More code means more chances to\nmake an error and more places for bugs to hide. One way to cut your debugging time is \u201cdebugging by bisection\u201d.\nFor example, if there are 100 lines in your program and you\ncheck them one at a time, it would take 100 steps. Instead, try to break the problem in half. Look at the middle\nof the program, or near it, for an intermediate value you\ncan check. Add a print statement (or something else\nthat has a verifiable effect) and run the program. If the mid-point check is incorrect, there must be a problem in the\nfirst half of the program. If it is correct, the problem is\nin the second half. Every time you perform a check like this, you halve the number of\nlines you have to search. After six steps (which is fewer than 100),\nyou would be down to one or two lines of code, at least in theory. In practice it is not always clear what\nthe \u201cmiddle of the program\u201d is and not always possible to\ncheck it. It doesn\u2019t make sense to count lines and find the\nexact midpoint. Instead, think about places\nin the program where there might be errors and places where it\nis easy to put a check. Then choose a spot where you\nthink the chances are about the same that the bug is before\nor after the check. 7.8\u00a0\u00a0Glossary reassignment: Assigning a new value to a variable that\nalready exists. update: An assignment where the new value of the variable\ndepends on the old. initialization: An assignment that gives an initial value to\na variable that will be updated. increment: An update that increases the value of a variable\n(often by one). decrement: An update that decreases the value of a variable. iteration: Repeated execution of a set of statements using\neither a recursive function call or a loop. infinite loop: A loop in which the terminating condition is\nnever satisfied. algorithm: A general process for solving a category of\nproblems. 7.9\u00a0\u00a0Exercises Exercise\u00a01 Copy the loop from Section 7.5 and encapsulate it in a function called mysqrt that takes a as a parameter, chooses a\nreasonable value of x , and returns an estimate of the square\nroot of a . To test it, write a function named test_square_root that prints a table like this: a   mysqrt(a)     math.sqrt(a)  diff\n-   ---------     ------------  ----\n1.0 1.0           1.0           0.0\n2.0 1.41421356237 1.41421356237 2.22044604925e-16\n3.0 1.73205080757 1.73205080757 0.0\n4.0 2.0           2.0           0.0\n5.0 2.2360679775  2.2360679775  0.0\n6.0 2.44948974278 2.44948974278 0.0\n7.0 2.64575131106 2.64575131106 0.0\n8.0 2.82842712475 2.82842712475 4.4408920985e-16\n9.0 3.0           3.0           0.0 The first column is a number, a ; the second column is the square\nroot of a computed with mysqrt ; the third column is the\nsquare root computed by math.sqrt ; the fourth column is the\nabsolute value of the difference between the two estimates. Exercise\u00a02 The built-in function eval takes a string and evaluates\nit using the Python interpreter. For example: >>> eval('1 + 2 * 3')\n7\n>>> import math\n>>> eval('math.sqrt(5)')\n2.2360679774997898\n>>> eval('type(math.pi)')\n<class 'float'> Write a function called eval_loop that iteratively\nprompts the user, takes the resulting input and evaluates\nit using eval , and prints the result. It should continue until the user enters 'done' , and then\nreturn the value of the last expression it evaluated. Exercise\u00a03 The mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan found an\ninfinite series\nthat can be used to generate a numerical\napproximation of 1 / \u03c0 : 1 \u03c0 = 2 \u221a 2 9801 \u221e \u2211 k =0 (4 k )!(1103+26390 k ) ( k !) 4 396 4 k Write a function called estimate_pi that uses this formula\nto compute and return an estimate of \u03c0 . It should use a while loop to compute terms of the summation until the last term is\nsmaller than 1e-15 (which is Python notation for 10 \u221215 ).\nYou can check the result by comparing it to math.pi .
