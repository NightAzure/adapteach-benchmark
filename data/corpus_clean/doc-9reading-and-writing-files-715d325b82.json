You can think of a file\u2019s contents as a single string value, potentially gigabytes in size. In this chapter, you will learn how to use Python to create, read, and save files on the hard drive.\n\n### Files and File Paths\n\nA file has two key properties: a filename (usually written as one word) and a path . The path specifies the location of a file on the computer. For example, there is a file on my Windows laptop with the filename project.docx in the path C:\\Users\\Al\\Documents . The part of the filename after the last period is called the file\u2019s extension and tells you a file\u2019s type. The filename project.docx is a Word document, and Users , Al , and Documents all refer to folders (also called directories ). Folders can contain files and other folders. For example, project.docx is in the Documents folder, which is inside the Al folder, which is inside the Users folder. Figure 9-1 shows this folder organization.\n\nFigure 9-1: A file in a hierarchy of folders\n\nThe C:\\ part of the path is the root folder , which contains all other folders. On Windows, the root folder is named C:\\ and is also called the C: drive . On macOS and Linux, the root folder is / . In this book, I\u2019ll use the Windows-style root folder, C:\\ . If you are entering the interactive shell examples on macOS or Linux, enter / instead.\n\nAdditional volumes , such as a DVD drive or USB flash drive, will appear differently on different operating systems. On Windows, they appear as new, lettered root drives, such as D:\\ or E:\\ . On macOS, they appear as new folders under the /Volumes folder. On Linux, they appear as new folders under the /mnt (\u201cmount\u201d) folder. Also note that while folder names and filenames are not case-sensitive on Windows and macOS, they are case-sensitive on Linux.\n\nNOTE\n\nSince your system probably has different files and folders on it than mine, you won\u2019t be able to follow every example in this chapter exactly. Still, try to follow along using folders that exist on your computer.\n\n#### Backslash on Windows and Forward Slash on macOS and Linux\n\nOn Windows, paths are written using backslashes ( \\ ) as the separator between folder names. The macOS and Linux operating systems, however, use the forward slash ( / ) as their path separator. If you want your programs to work on all operating systems, you will have to write your Python scripts to handle both cases.\n\nFortunately, this is simple to do with the Path() function in the pathlib module. If you pass it the string values of individual file and folder names in your path, Path() will return a string with a file path using the correct path separators. Enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> from pathlib import Path >>> Path('spam', 'bacon', 'eggs') WindowsPath('spam/bacon/eggs') >>> str(Path('spam', 'bacon', 'eggs')) 'spam\\\\bacon\\\\eggs'\n\nNote that the convention for importing pathlib is to run from pathlib import Path , since otherwise we\u2019d have to enter pathlib.Path everywhere Path shows up in our code. Not only is this extra typing redundant, but it\u2019s also redundant.\n\nI\u2019m running this chapter\u2019s interactive shell examples on Windows, so Path('spam', 'bacon', 'eggs') returned a WindowsPath object for the joined path, represented as WindowsPath('spam/bacon/eggs') . Even though Windows uses backslashes, the WindowsPath representation in the interactive shell displays them using forward slashes, since open source software developers have historically favored the Linux operating system.\n\nIf you want to get a simple text string of this path, you can pass it to the str() function, which in our example returns 'spam\\\\bacon\\\\eggs' . (Notice that the backslashes are doubled because each backslash needs to be escaped by another backslash character.) If I had called this function on, say, Linux, Path() would have returned a PosixPath object that, when passed to str() , would have returned 'spam/bacon/eggs' . ( POSIX is a set of standards for Unix-like operating systems such as Linux.)\n\nThese Path objects (really, WindowsPath or PosixPath objects, depending on your operating system) will be passed to several of the file-related functions introduced in this chapter. For example, the following code joins names from a list of filenames to the end of a folder\u2019s name:\n\n>>> from pathlib import Path >>> myFiles = ['accounts.txt', 'details.csv', 'invite.docx'] >>> for filename in myFiles: print(Path(r'C:\\Users\\Al', filename)) C:\\Users\\Al\\accounts.txt C:\\Users\\Al\\details.csv C:\\Users\\Al\\invite.docx\n\nOn Windows, the backslash separates directories, so you can\u2019t use it in filenames. However, you can use backslashes in filenames on macOS and Linux. So while Path(r'spam\\eggs') refers to two separate folders (or a file eggs in a folder spam ) on Windows, the same command would refer to a single folder (or file) named spam\\eggs on macOS and Linux. For this reason, it\u2019s usually a good idea to always use forward slashes in your Python code (and I\u2019ll be doing so for the rest of this chapter). The pathlib module will ensure that it always works on all operating systems.\n\nNote that pathlib was introduced in Python 3.4 to replace older os.path functions. The Python Standard Library modules support it as of Python 3.6, but if you are working with legacy Python 2 versions, I recommend using pathlib2 , which gives you pathlib \u2019s features on Python 2.7. Appendix A has instructions for installing pathlib2 using pip. Whenever I\u2019ve replaced an older os.path function with pathlib , I\u2019ve made a short note. You can look up the older functions at https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html .\n\n#### Using the / Operator to Join Paths\n\nWe normally use the + operator to add two integer or floating-point numbers, such as in the expression 2 + 2 , which evaluates to the integer value 4 . But we can also use the + operator to concatenate two string values, like the expression 'Hello' + 'World' , which evaluates to the string value 'HelloWorld' . Similarly, the / operator that we normally use for division can also combine Path objects and strings. This is helpful for modifying a Path object after you\u2019ve already created it with the Path() function.\n\nFor example, enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> from pathlib import Path >>> Path('spam') / 'bacon' / 'eggs' WindowsPath('spam/bacon/eggs') >>> Path('spam') / Path('bacon/eggs') WindowsPath('spam/bacon/eggs') >>> Path('spam') / Path('bacon', 'eggs') WindowsPath('spam/bacon/eggs')\n\nUsing the / operator with Path objects makes joining paths just as easy as string concatenation. It\u2019s also safer than using string concatenation or the join() method, like we do in this example:\n\n>>> homeFolder = r'C:\\Users\\Al' >>> subFolder = 'spam' >>> homeFolder + '\\\\' + subFolder 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Al\\\\spam' >>> '\\\\'.join([homeFolder, subFolder]) 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Al\\\\spam'\n\nA script that uses this code isn\u2019t safe, because its backslashes would only work on Windows. You could add an if statement that checks sys.platform (which contains a string describing the computer\u2019s operating system) to decide what kind of slash to use, but applying this custom code everywhere it\u2019s needed can be inconsistent and bug-prone.\n\nThe pathlib module solves these problems by reusing the / math division operator to join paths correctly, no matter what operating system your code is running on. The following example uses this strategy to join the same paths as in the previous example:\n\n>>> homeFolder = Path('C:/Users/Al') >>> subFolder = Path('spam') >>> homeFolder / subFolder WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/spam') >>> str(homeFolder / subFolder) 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Al\\\\spam'\n\nThe only thing you need to keep in mind when using the / operator for joining paths is that one of the first two values must be a Path object. Python will give you an error if you try entering the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> 'spam' / 'bacon' / 'eggs' Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'str'\n\nPython evaluates the / operator from left to right and evaluates to a Path object, so either the first or second leftmost value must be a Path object for the entire expression to evaluate to a Path object. Here\u2019s how the / operator and a Path object evaluate to the final Path object.\n\nIf you see the TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'str' error message shown previously, you need to put a Path object on the left side of the expression.\n\nThe / operator replaces the older os.path.join() function, which you can learn more about from https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.join .\n\n#### The Current Working Directory\n\nEvery program that runs on your computer has a current working directory , or cwd . Any filenames or paths that do not begin with the root folder are assumed to be under the current working directory.\n\nNOTE\n\nWhile folder is the more modern name for directory, note that current working directory (or just working directory ) is the standard term, not \u201ccurrent working folder.\u201d\n\nYou can get the current working directory as a string value with the Path.cwd() function and change it using os.chdir() . Enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> from pathlib import Path >>> import os >>> Path.cwd() WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python37')' >>> os.chdir('C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32') >>> Path.cwd() WindowsPath('C:/Windows/System32')\n\nHere, the current working directory is set to C:\\Users\\Al\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python37 , so the filename project.docx refers to C:\\Users\\Al\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python37\\project.docx . When we change the current working directory to C:\\Windows\\System32 , the filename project.docx is interpreted as C:\\Windows\\System32\\project.docx .\n\nPython will display an error if you try to change to a directory that does not exist.\n\n>>> os.chdir('C:/ThisFolderDoesNotExist') Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module> FileNotFoundError: [WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified: 'C:/ThisFolderDoesNotExist'\n\nThere is no pathlib function for changing the working directory, because changing the current working directory while a program is running can often lead to subtle bugs.\n\nThe os.getcwd() function is the older way of getting the current working directory as a string.\n\n#### The Home Directory\n\nAll users have a folder for their own files on the computer called the home directory or home folder . You can get a Path object of the home folder by calling Path.home() :\n\n>>> Path.home() WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al')\n\nThe home directories are located in a set place depending on your operating system:\n\n- On Windows, home directories are under C:\\Users .\n- On Mac, home directories are under /Users .\n- On Linux, home directories are often under /home .\n\nYour scripts will almost certainly have permissions to read and write the files under your home directory, so it\u2019s an ideal place to put the files that your Python programs will work with.\n\n#### Absolute vs. Relative Paths\n\nThere are two ways to specify a file path:\n\n- An absolute path , which always begins with the root folder\n- A relative path , which is relative to the program\u2019s current working directory\n\nThere are also the dot ( . ) and dot-dot ( .. ) folders. These are not real folders but special names that can be used in a path. A single period (\u201cdot\u201d) for a folder name is shorthand for \u201cthis directory.\u201d Two periods (\u201cdot-dot\u201d) means \u201cthe parent folder.\u201d\n\nFigure 9-2 is an example of some folders and files. When the current working directory is set to C:\\bacon , the relative paths for the other folders and files are set as they are in the figure.\n\nFigure 9-2: The relative paths for folders and files in the working directory C:\\bacon\n\nThe .\\ at the start of a relative path is optional. For example, .\\spam.txt and spam.txt refer to the same file.\n\n#### Creating New Folders Using the os.makedirs() Function\n\nYour programs can create new folders (directories) with the os.makedirs() function. Enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> import os >>> os.makedirs('C:\\\\delicious\\\\walnut\\\\waffles')\n\nThis will create not just the C:\\delicious folder but also a walnut folder inside C:\\delicious and a waffles folder inside C:\\delicious\\walnut . That is, os.makedirs() will create any necessary intermediate folders in order to ensure that the full path exists. Figure 9-3 shows this hierarchy of folders.\n\nFigure 9-3: The result of os.makedirs('C:\\\\delicious\\\\walnut\\\\waffles')\n\nTo make a directory from a Path object, call the mkdir() method. For example, this code will create a spam folder under the home folder on my computer:\n\n>>> from pathlib import Path >>> Path(r'C:\\Users\\Al\\spam').mkdir()\n\nNote that mkdir() can only make one directory at a time; it won\u2019t make several subdirectories at once like os.makedirs() .\n\n#### Handling Absolute and Relative Paths\n\nThe pathlib module provides methods for checking whether a given path is an absolute path and returning the absolute path of a relative path.\n\nCalling the is_absolute() method on a Path object will return True if it represents an absolute path or False if it represents a relative path. For example, enter the following into the interactive shell, using your own files and folders instead of the exact ones listed here:\n\n>>> Path.cwd() WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python37') >>> Path.cwd().is_absolute() True >>> Path('spam/bacon/eggs').is_absolute() False\n\nTo get an absolute path from a relative path, you can put Path.cwd() / in front of the relative Path object. After all, when we say \u201crelative path,\u201d we almost always mean a path that is relative to the current working directory. Enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> Path('my/relative/path') WindowsPath('my/relative/path') >>> Path.cwd() / Path('my/relative/path') WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python37/my/relative/ path')\n\nIf your relative path is relative to another path besides the current working directory, just replace Path.cwd() with that other path instead. The following example gets an absolute path using the home directory instead of the current working directory:\n\n>>> Path('my/relative/path') WindowsPath('my/relative/path') >>> Path.home() / Path('my/relative/path') WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/my/relative/path')\n\nThe os.path module also has some useful functions related to absolute and relative paths:\n\n- Calling os.path.abspath( path ) will return a string of the absolute path of the argument. This is an easy way to convert a relative path into an absolute one.\n- Calling os.path.isabs( path ) will return True if the argument is an absolute path and False if it is a relative path.\n- Calling os.path.relpath( path , start ) will return a string of a relative path from the start path to path . If start is not provided, the current working directory is used as the start path.\n\nTry these functions in the interactive shell:\n\n>>> os.path.abspath('.') 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Al\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\Python37' >>> os.path.abspath('.\\\\Scripts') 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Al\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\Python37\\\\Scripts' >>> os.path.isabs('.') False >>> os.path.isabs(os.path.abspath('.')) True\n\nSince C:\\Users\\Al\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python37 was the working directory when os.path.abspath() was called, the \u201csingle-dot\u201d folder represents the absolute path 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Al\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Programs\\\\Python\\\\Python37' .\n\nEnter the following calls to os.path.relpath() into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> os.path.relpath('C:\\\\Windows', 'C:\\\\') 'Windows' >>> os.path.relpath('C:\\\\Windows', 'C:\\\\spam\\\\eggs') '..\\\\..\\\\Windows'\n\nWhen the relative path is within the same parent folder as the path, but is within subfolders of a different path, such as 'C:\\\\Windows' and 'C:\\\\spam\\\\eggs' , you can use the \u201cdot-dot\u201d notation to return to the parent folder.\n\n#### Getting the Parts of a File Path\n\nGiven a Path object, you can extract the file path\u2019s different parts as strings using several Path object attributes. These can be useful for constructing new file paths based on existing ones. The attributes are diagrammed in Figure 9-4.\n\nFigure 9-4: The parts of a Windows (top) and macOS/Linux (bottom) file path\n\nThe parts of a file path include the following:\n\n- The anchor , which is the root folder of the filesystem\n- On Windows, the drive , which is the single letter that often denotes a physical hard drive or other storage device\n- The parent , which is the folder that contains the file\n- The name of the file, made up of the stem (or base name ) and the suffix (or extension )\n\nNote that Windows Path objects have a drive attribute, but macOS and Linux Path objects don\u2019t. The drive attribute doesn\u2019t include the first backslash.\n\nTo extract each attribute from the file path, enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> p = Path('C:/Users/Al/spam.txt') >>> p.anchor 'C:\\\\' >>> p.parent # This is a Path object, not a string. WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al') >>> p.name 'spam.txt' >>> p.stem 'spam' >>> p.suffix '.txt' >>> p.drive 'C:'\n\nThese attributes evaluate to simple string values, except for parent , which evaluates to another Path object.\n\nThe parents attribute (which is different from the parent attribute) evaluates to the ancestor folders of a Path object with an integer index:\n\n>>> Path.cwd() WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python37') >>> Path.cwd().parents[0] WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/AppData/Local/Programs/Python') >>> Path.cwd().parents[1] WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/AppData/Local/Programs') >>> Path.cwd().parents[2] WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/AppData/Local') >>> Path.cwd().parents[3] WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/AppData') >>> Path.cwd().parents[4] WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al') >>> Path.cwd().parents[5] WindowsPath('C:/Users') >>> Path.cwd().parents[6] WindowsPath('C:/')\n\nThe older os.path module also has similar functions for getting the different parts of a path written in a string value. Calling os.path.dirname( path ) will return a string of everything that comes before the last slash in the path argument. Calling os.path.basename( path ) will return a string of everything that comes after the last slash in the path argument. The directory (or dir) name and base name of a path are outlined in Figure 9-5.\n\nFigure 9-5: The base name follows the last slash in a path and is the same as the filename. The dir name is everything before the last slash.\n\nFor example, enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> calcFilePath = 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\calc.exe' >>> os.path.basename(calcFilePath) 'calc.exe' >>> os.path.dirname(calcFilePath) 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32'\n\nIf you need a path\u2019s dir name and base name together, you can just call os.path.split() to get a tuple value with these two strings, like so:\n\n>>> calcFilePath = 'C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\calc.exe' >>> os.path.split(calcFilePath) ('C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32', 'calc.exe')\n\nNotice that you could create the same tuple by calling os.path.dirname() and os.path.basename() and placing their return values in a tuple:\n\n>>> (os.path.dirname(calcFilePath), os.path.basename(calcFilePath)) ('C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32', 'calc.exe')\n\nBut os.path.split() is a nice shortcut if you need both values.\n\nAlso, note that os.path.split() does not take a file path and return a list of strings of each folder. For that, use the split() string method and split on the string in os.sep . (Note that sep is in os , not os.path .) The os.sep variable is set to the correct folder-separating slash for the computer running the program, '\\\\' on Windows and '/' on macOS and Linux, and splitting on it will return a list of the individual folders.\n\nFor example, enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> calcFilePath.split(os.sep) ['C:', 'Windows', 'System32', 'calc.exe']\n\nThis returns all the parts of the path as strings.\n\nOn macOS and Linux systems, the returned list of folders will begin with a blank string, like this:\n\n>>> '/usr/bin'.split(os. sep) ['', 'usr', 'bin']\n\nThe split() string method will work to return a list of each part of the path.\n\n#### Finding File Sizes and Folder Contents\n\nOnce you have ways of handling file paths, you can then start gathering information about specific files and folders. The os.path module provides functions for finding the size of a file in bytes and the files and folders inside a given folder.\n\n- Calling os.path.getsize( path ) will return the size in bytes of the file in the path argument.\n- Calling os.listdir( path ) will return a list of filename strings for each file in the path argument. (Note that this function is in the os module, not os.path .)\n\nHere\u2019s what I get when I try these functions in the interactive shell:\n\n>>> os.path.getsize('C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\calc.exe') 27648 >>> os.listdir('C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32') ['0409', '12520437.cpx', '12520850.cpx', '5U877.ax', 'aaclient.dll', -- snip -- 'xwtpdui.dll', 'xwtpw32.dll', 'zh-CN', 'zh-HK', 'zh-TW', 'zipfldr.dll']\n\nAs you can see, the calc.exe program on my computer is 27,648 bytes in size, and I have a lot of files in C:\\Windows\\system32 . If I want to find the total size of all the files in this directory, I can use os.path.getsize() and os.listdir() together.\n\n>>> totalSize = 0 >>> for filename in os.listdir('C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32'): totalSize = totalSize + os.path.getsize(os.path.join('C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32', filename)) >>> print(totalSize) 2559970473\n\nAs I loop over each filename in the C:\\Windows\\System32 folder, the totalSize variable is incremented by the size of each file. Notice how when I call os.path.getsize() , I use os.path.join() to join the folder name with the current filename. The integer that os.path.getsize() returns is added to the value of totalSize . After looping through all the files, I print totalSize to see the total size of the C:\\Windows\\System32 folder.\n\n#### Modifying a List of Files Using Glob Patterns\n\nIf you want to work on specific files, the glob() method is simpler to use than listdir() . Path objects have a glob() method for listing the contents of a folder according to a glob pattern . Glob patterns are like a simplified form of regular expressions often used in command line commands. The glob() method returns a generator object (which are beyond the scope of this book) that you\u2019ll need to pass to list() to easily view in the interactive shell:\n\n>>> p = Path('C:/Users/Al/Desktop') >>> p.glob('*') <generator object Path.glob at 0x000002A6E389DED0> >>> list(p.glob('*')) # Make a list from the generator. [WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/Desktop/1.png'), WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/ Desktop/22-ap.pdf'), WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/Desktop/cat.jpg'), --snip-- WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/Desktop/zzz.txt')]\n\nThe asterisk ( * ) stands for \u201cmultiple of any characters,\u201d so p.glob('*') returns a generator of all files in the path stored in p .\n\nLike with regexes, you can create complex expressions:\n\n>>> list(p.glob('*.txt') # Lists all text files. [WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/Desktop/foo.txt'), --snip-- WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/Desktop/zzz.txt')]\n\nThe glob pattern '*.txt' will return files that start with any combination of characters as long as it ends with the string '.txt' , which is the text file extension.\n\nIn contrast with the asterisk, the question mark ( ? ) stands for any single character:\n\n>>> list(p.glob('project?.docx') [WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/Desktop/project1.docx'), WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/ Desktop/project2.docx'), --snip-- WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/Desktop/project9.docx')]\n\nThe glob expression 'project?.docx' will return 'project1.docx' or 'project5.docx' , but it will not return 'project10.docx' , because ? only matches to one character\u2014so it will not match to the two-character string '10' .\n\nFinally, you can also combine the asterisk and question mark to create even more complex glob expressions, like this:\n\n>>> list(p.glob('*.?x?') [WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/Desktop/calc.exe'), WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/ Desktop/foo.txt'), --snip-- WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/Desktop/zzz.txt')]\n\nThe glob expression '*.?x?' will return files with any name and any three-character extension where the middle character is an 'x' .\n\nBy picking out files with specific attributes, the glob() method lets you easily specify the files in a directory you want to perform some operation on. You can use a for loop to iterate over the generator that glob() returns:\n\n>>> p = Path('C:/Users/Al/Desktop') >>> for textFilePathObj in p.glob('*.txt'): ... print(textFilePathObj) # Prints the Path object as a string. ... # Do something with the text file. ... C:\\Users\\Al\\Desktop\\foo.txt C:\\Users\\Al\\Desktop\\spam.txt C:\\Users\\Al\\Desktop\\zzz.txt\n\nIf you want to perform some operation on every file in a directory, you can use either os.listdir(p) or p.glob('*') .\n\n#### Checking Path Validity\n\nMany Python functions will crash with an error if you supply them with a path that does not exist. Luckily, Path objects have methods to check whether a given path exists and whether it is a file or folder. Assuming that a variable p holds a Path object, you could expect the following:\n\n- Calling p.exists() returns True if the path exists or returns False if it doesn\u2019t exist.\n- Calling p.is_file() returns True if the path exists and is a file, or returns False otherwise.\n- Calling p.is_dir() returns True if the path exists and is a directory, or returns False otherwise.\n\nOn my computer, here\u2019s what I get when I try these methods in the interactive shell:\n\n>>> winDir = Path('C:/Windows') >>> notExistsDir = Path('C:/This/Folder/Does/Not/Exist') >>> calcFile = Path('C:/Windows /System32/calc.exe') >>> winDir.exists() True >>> winDir.is_dir() True >>> notExistsDir.exists() False >>> calcFile.is_file() True >>> calcFile.is_dir() False\n\nYou can determine whether there is a DVD or flash drive currently attached to the computer by checking for it with the exists() method. For instance, if I wanted to check for a flash drive with the volume named D:\\ on my Windows computer, I could do that with the following:\n\n>>> dDrive = Path('D:/') >>> dDrive.exists() False\n\nOops! It looks like I forgot to plug in my flash drive.\n\nThe older os.path module can accomplish the same task with the os.path.exists( path ) , os.path.isfile( path ) , and os.path.isdir( path ) functions, which act just like their Path function counterparts. As of Python 3.6, these functions can accept Path objects as well as strings of the file paths.\n\n### The File Reading/Writing Process\n\nOnce you are comfortable working with folders and relative paths, you\u2019ll be able to specify the location of files to read and write. The functions covered in the next few sections will apply to plaintext files. Plaintext files contain only basic text characters and do not include font, size, or color information. Text files with the .txt extension or Python script files with the .py extension are examples of plaintext files. These can be opened with Windows\u2019s Notepad or macOS\u2019s TextEdit application. Your programs can easily read the contents of plaintext files and treat them as an ordinary string value.\n\nBinary files are all other file types, such as word processing documents, PDFs, images, spreadsheets, and executable programs. If you open a binary file in Notepad or TextEdit, it will look like scrambled nonsense, like in Figure 9-6.\n\nFigure 9-6: The Windows calc.exe program opened in Notepad\n\nSince every different type of binary file must be handled in its own way, this book will not go into reading and writing raw binary files directly. Fortunately, many modules make working with binary files easier\u2014you will explore one of them, the shelve module, later in this chapter. The pathlib module\u2019s read_text() method returns a string of the full contents of a text file. Its write_text() method creates a new text file (or overwrites an existing one) with the string passed to it. Enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> from pathlib import Path >>> p = Path('spam.txt') >>> p.write_text('Hello, world!') 13 >>> p.read_text() 'Hello, world!'\n\nThese method calls create a spam.txt file with the content 'Hello, world!' . The 13 that write_text() returns indicates that 13 characters were written to the file. (You can often disregard this information.) The read_text() call reads and returns the contents of our new file as a string: 'Hello, world!' .\n\nKeep in mind that these Path object methods only provide basic interactions with files. The more common way of writing to a file involves using the open() function and file objects. There are three steps to reading or writing files in Python:\n\n- Call the open() function to return a File object.\n- Call the read() or write() method on the File object.\n- Close the file by calling the close() method on the File object.\n\nWe\u2019ll go over these steps in the following sections.\n\n#### Opening Files with the open() Function\n\nTo open a file with the open() function, you pass it a string path indicating the file you want to open; it can be either an absolute or relative path. The open() function returns a File object.\n\nTry it by creating a text file named hello.txt using Notepad or TextEdit. Type Hello, world! as the content of this text file and save it in your user home folder. Then enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> helloFile = open(Path.home() / 'hello.txt')\n\nThe open() function can also accept strings. If you\u2019re using Windows, enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> helloFile = open('C:\\\\Users\\\\ your_home_folder \\\\hello.txt')\n\nIf you\u2019re using macOS, enter the following into the interactive shell instead:\n\n>>> helloFile = open('/Users/ your_home_folder /hello.txt')\n\nMake sure to replace your_home_folder with your computer username. For example, my username is Al , so I\u2019d enter 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Al\\\\hello.txt' on Windows. Note that the open() function only accepts Path objects as of Python 3.6. In previous versions, you always need to pass a string to open() .\n\nBoth these commands will open the file in \u201creading plaintext\u201d mode, or read mode for short. When a file is opened in read mode, Python lets you only read data from the file; you can\u2019t write or modify it in any way. Read mode is the default mode for files you open in Python. But if you don\u2019t want to rely on Python\u2019s defaults, you can explicitly specify the mode by passing the string value 'r' as a second argument to open() . So open('/Users/Al/hello.txt', 'r') and open('/Users/Al/hello.txt') do the same thing.\n\nThe call to open() returns a File object. A File object represents a file on your computer; it is simply another type of value in Python, much like the lists and dictionaries you\u2019re already familiar with. In the previous example, you stored the File object in the variable helloFile . Now, whenever you want to read from or write to the file, you can do so by calling methods on the File object in helloFile .\n\n#### Reading the Contents of Files\n\nNow that you have a File object, you can start reading from it. If you want to read the entire contents of a file as a string value, use the File object\u2019s read() method. Let\u2019s continue with the hello.txt File object you stored in helloFile . Enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> helloContent = helloFile.read() >>> helloContent 'Hello, world!'\n\nIf you think of the contents of a file as a single large string value, the read() method returns the string that is stored in the file.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the readlines() method to get a list of string values from the file, one string for each line of text. For example, create a file named sonnet29.txt in the same directory as hello.txt and write the following text in it:\n\nWhen, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes, I all alone beweep my outcast state, And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries, And look upon myself and curse my fate,\n\nMake sure to separate the four lines with line breaks. Then enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> sonnetFile = open(Path.home() / 'sonnet29.txt') >>> sonnetFile.readlines() [When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,\\n', ' I all alone beweep my outcast state,\\n', And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\\n', And look upon myself and curse my fate,']\n\nNote that, except for the last line of the file, each of the string values ends with a newline character \\n . A list of strings is often easier to work with than a single large string value.\n\n#### Writing to Files\n\nPython allows you to write content to a file in a way similar to how the print() function \u201cwrites\u201d strings to the screen. You can\u2019t write to a file you\u2019ve opened in read mode, though. Instead, you need to open it in \u201cwrite plaintext\u201d mode or \u201cappend plaintext\u201d mode, or write mode and append mode for short.\n\nWrite mode will overwrite the existing file and start from scratch, just like when you overwrite a variable\u2019s value with a new value. Pass 'w' as the second argument to open() to open the file in write mode. Append mode, on the other hand, will append text to the end of the existing file. You can think of this as appending to a list in a variable, rather than overwriting the variable altogether. Pass 'a' as the second argument to open() to open the file in append mode.\n\nIf the filename passed to open() does not exist, both write and append mode will create a new, blank file. After reading or writing a file, call the close() method before opening the file again.\n\nLet\u2019s put these concepts together. Enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> baconFile = open('bacon.txt', 'w') >>> baconFile.write('Hello, world!\\n') 13 >>> baconFile.close() >>> baconFile = open('bacon.txt', 'a') >>> baconFile.write('Bacon is not a vegetable.') 25 >>> baconFile.close() >>> baconFile = open('bacon.txt') >>> content = baconFile.read() >>> baconFile.close() >>> print(content) Hello, world! Bacon is not a vegetable.\n\nFirst, we open bacon.txt in write mode. Since there isn\u2019t a bacon.txt yet, Python creates one. Calling write() on the opened file and passing write() the string argument 'Hello, world! /n' writes the string to the file and returns the number of characters written, including the newline. Then we close the file.\n\nTo add text to the existing contents of the file instead of replacing the string we just wrote, we open the file in append mode. We write 'Bacon is not a vegetable.' to the file and close it. Finally, to print the file contents to the screen, we open the file in its default read mode, call read() , store the resulting File object in content , close the file, and print content .\n\nNote that the write() method does not automatically add a newline character to the end of the string like the print() function does. You will have to add this character yourself.\n\nAs of Python 3.6, you can also pass a Path object to the open() function instead of a string for the filename.\n\n### Saving Variables with the shelve Module\n\nYou can save variables in your Python programs to binary shelf files using the shelve module. This way, your program can restore data to variables from the hard drive. The shelve module will let you add Save and Open features to your program. For example, if you ran a program and entered some configuration settings, you could save those settings to a shelf file and then have the program load them the next time it is run.\n\nEnter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> import shelve >>> shelfFile = shelve.open('mydata') >>> cats = ['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Simon'] >>> shelfFile['cats'] = cats >>> shelfFile.close()\n\nTo read and write data using the shelve module, you first import shelve . Call shelve.open() and pass it a filename, and then store the returned shelf value in a variable. You can make changes to the shelf value as if it were a dictionary. When you\u2019re done, call close() on the shelf value. Here, our shelf value is stored in shelfFile . We create a list cats and write shelfFile['cats'] = cats to store the list in shelfFile as a value associated with the key 'cats' (like in a dictionary). Then we call close() on shelfFile . Note that as of Python 3.7, you have to pass the open() shelf method filenames as strings. You can\u2019t pass it Path object.\n\nAfter running the previous code on Windows, you will see three new files in the current working directory: mydata.bak , mydata.dat , and mydata.dir . On macOS, only a single mydata.db file will be created.\n\nThese binary files contain the data you stored in your shelf. The format of these binary files is not important; you only need to know what the shelve module does, not how it does it. The module frees you from worrying about how to store your program\u2019s data to a file.\n\nYour programs can use the shelve module to later reopen and retrieve the data from these shelf files. Shelf values don\u2019t have to be opened in read or write mode\u2014they can do both once opened. Enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> shelfFile = shelve.open('mydata') >>> type(shelfFile) <class 'shelve.DbfilenameShelf'> >>> shelfFile['cats'] ['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Simon'] >>> shelfFile.close()\n\nHere, we open the shelf files to check that our data was stored correctly. Entering shelfFile['cats'] returns the same list that we stored earlier, so we know that the list is correctly stored, and we call close() .\n\nJust like dictionaries, shelf values have keys() and values() methods that will return list-like values of the keys and values in the shelf. Since these methods return list-like values instead of true lists, you should pass them to the list() function to get them in list form. Enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> shelfFile = shelve.open('mydata') >>> list(shelfFile.keys()) ['cats'] >>> list(shelfFile.values()) [['Zophie', 'Pooka', 'Simon']] >>> shelfFile.close()\n\nPlaintext is useful for creating files that you\u2019ll read in a text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit, but if you want to save data from your Python programs, use the shelve module.\n\n### Saving Variables with the pprint.pformat() Function\n\nRecall from \u201cPretty Printing\u201d on page 118 that the pprint.pprint() function will \u201cpretty print\u201d the contents of a list or dictionary to the screen, while the pprint.pformat() function will return this same text as a string instead of printing it. Not only is this string formatted to be easy to read, but it is also syntactically correct Python code. Say you have a dictionary stored in a variable and you want to save this variable and its contents for future use. Using pprint.pformat() will give you a string that you can write to a .py file. This file will be your very own module that you can import whenever you want to use the variable stored in it.\n\nFor example, enter the following into the interactive shell:\n\n>>> import pprint >>> cats = [{'name': 'Zophie', 'desc': 'chubby'}, {'name': 'Pooka', 'desc': 'fluffy'}] >>> pprint.pformat(cats) \"[{'desc': 'chubby', 'name': 'Zophie'}, {'desc': 'fluffy', 'name': 'Pooka'}]\" >>> fileObj = open('myCats.py', 'w') >>> fileObj.write('cats = ' + pprint.pformat(cats) + '\\n') 83 >>> fileObj.close()\n\nHere, we import pprint to let us use pprint.pformat() . We have a list of dictionaries, stored in a variable cats . To keep the list in cats available even after we close the shell, we use pprint.pformat() to return it as a string. Once we have the data in cats as a string, it\u2019s easy to write the string to a file, which we\u2019ll call myCats.py .\n\nThe modules that an import statement imports are themselves just Python scripts. When the string from pprint.pformat() is saved to a .py file, the file is a module that can be imported just like any other.\n\nAnd since Python scripts are themselves just text files with the .py file extension, your Python programs can even generate other Python programs. You can then import these files into scripts.\n\n>>> import myCats >>> myCats.cats [{'name': 'Zophie', 'desc': 'chubby'}, {'name': 'Pooka', 'desc': 'fluffy'}] >>> myCats.cats[0] {'name': 'Zophie', 'desc': 'chubby'} >>> myCats.cats[0]['name'] 'Zophie'\n\nThe benefit of creating a .py file (as opposed to saving variables with the shelve module) is that because it is a text file, the contents of the file can be read and modified by anyone with a simple text editor. For most applications, however, saving data using the shelve module is the preferred way to save variables to a file. Only basic data types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, and dictionaries can be written to a file as simple text. File objects, for example, cannot be encoded as text.\n\n### Project: Generating Random Quiz Files\n\nSay you\u2019re a geography teacher with 35 students in your class and you want to give a pop quiz on US state capitals. Alas, your class has a few bad eggs in it, and you can\u2019t trust the students not to cheat. You\u2019d like to randomize the order of questions so that each quiz is unique, making it impossible for anyone to crib answers from anyone else. Of course, doing this by hand would be a lengthy and boring affair. Fortunately, you know some Python.\n\nHere is what the program does:\n\n- Creates 35 different quizzes\n- Creates 50 multiple-choice questions for each quiz, in random order\n- Provides the correct answer and three random wrong answers for each question, in random order\n- Writes the quizzes to 35 text files\n- Writes the answer keys to 35 text files\n\nThis means the code will need to do the following:\n\n- Store the states and their capitals in a dictionary\n- Call open() , write() , and close() for the quiz and answer key text files\n- Use random.shuffle() to randomize the order of the questions and multiple-choice options\n\n#### Step 1: Store the Quiz Data in a Dictionary\n\nThe first step is to create a skeleton script and fill it with your quiz data. Create a file named randomQuizGenerator.py , and make it look like the following:\n\n#! python3 # randomQuizGenerator.py - Creates quizzes with questions and answers in # random order, along with the answer key. \u278a import random # The quiz data. Keys are states and values are their capitals. \u278b capitals = {'Alabama': 'Montgomery', 'Alaska': 'Juneau', 'Arizona': 'Phoenix', 'Arkansas': 'Little Rock', 'California': 'Sacramento', 'Colorado': 'Denver', 'Connecticut': 'Hartford', 'Delaware': 'Dover', 'Florida': 'Tallahassee', 'Georgia': 'Atlanta', 'Hawaii': 'Honolulu', 'Idaho': 'Boise', 'Illinois': 'Springfield', 'Indiana': 'Indianapolis', 'Iowa': 'Des Moines', 'Kansas': 'Topeka', 'Kentucky': 'Frankfort', 'Louisiana': 'Baton Rouge', 'Maine': 'Augusta', 'Maryland': 'Annapolis', 'Massachusetts': 'Boston', 'Michigan': 'Lansing', 'Minnesota': 'Saint Paul', 'Mississippi': 'Jackson', 'Missouri': 'Jefferson City', 'Montana': 'Helena', 'Nebraska': 'Lincoln', 'Nevada': 'Carson City', 'New Hampshire': 'Concord', 'New Jersey': 'Trenton', 'New Mexico': 'Santa Fe', 'New York': 'Albany', 'North Carolina': 'Raleigh', 'North Dakota': 'Bismarck', 'Ohio': 'Columbus', 'Oklahoma': 'Oklahoma City', 'Oregon': 'Salem', 'Pennsylvania': 'Harrisburg', 'Rhode Island': 'Providence', 'South Carolina': 'Columbia', 'South Dakota': 'Pierre', 'Tennessee': 'Nashville', 'Texas': 'Austin', 'Utah': 'Salt Lake City', 'Vermont': 'Montpelier', 'Virginia': 'Richmond', 'Washington': 'Olympia', 'West Virginia': 'Charleston', 'Wisconsin': 'Madison', 'Wyoming': 'Cheyenne'} # Generate 35 quiz files. \u278c for quizNum in range(35): # TODO: Create the quiz and answer key files. # TODO: Write out the header for the quiz. # TODO: Shuffle the order of the states. # TODO: Loop through all 50 states, making a question for each.\n\nSince this program will be randomly ordering the questions and answers, you\u2019ll need to import the random module \u278a to make use of its functions. The capitals variable \u278b contains a dictionary with US states as keys and their capitals as values. And since you want to create 35 quizzes, the code that actually generates the quiz and answer key files (marked with TODO comments for now) will go inside a for loop that loops 35 times \u278c . (This number can be changed to generate any number of quiz files.)\n\n#### Step 2: Create the Quiz File and Shuffle the Question Order\n\nNow it\u2019s time to start filling in those TODO s.\n\nThe code in the loop will be repeated 35 times\u2014once for each quiz\u2014so you have to worry about only one quiz at a time within the loop. First you\u2019ll create the actual quiz file. It needs to have a unique filename and should also have some kind of standard header in it, with places for the student to fill in a name, date, and class period. Then you\u2019ll need to get a list of states in randomized order, which can be used later to create the questions and answers for the quiz.\n\nAdd the following lines of code to randomQuizGenerator.py :\n\n#! python3 # randomQuizGenerator.py - Creates quizzes with questions and answers in # random order, along with the answer key. -- snip -- # Generate 35 quiz files. for quizNum in range(35): # Create the quiz and answer key files. \u278a quizFile = open(f'capitalsquiz{quizNum + 1}.txt', 'w') \u278b answerKeyFile = open(f'capitalsquiz_answers{quizNum + 1}.txt', 'w') # Write out the header for the quiz. \u278c quizFile.write('Name:\\n\\nDate:\\n\\nPeriod:\\n\\n') quizFile.write((' ' * 20) + f'State Capitals Quiz (Form{quizNum + 1})') quizFile.write('\\n\\n') # Shuffle the order of the states. states = list(capitals.keys()) \u278d random.shuffle(states) # TODO: Loop through all 50 states, making a question for each.\n\nThe filenames for the quizzes will be capitalsquiz<N>.txt , where <N> is a unique number for the quiz that comes from quizNum , the for loop\u2019s counter. The answer key for capitalsquiz<N>.txt will be stored in a text file named capitalsquiz_answers<N>.txt . Each time through the loop, the {quizNum + 1} placeholder in f'capitalsquiz{quizNum + 1}.txt' and f'capitalsquiz_answers{quizNum + 1}.txt' will be replaced by the unique number, so the first quiz and answer key created will be capitalsquiz1.txt and capitalsquiz_answers1.txt . These files will be created with calls to the open() function at \u278a and \u278b , with 'w' as the second argument to open them in write mode.\n\nThe write() statements at \u278c create a quiz header for the student to fill out. Finally, a randomized list of US states is created with the help of the random.shuffle() function \u278d , which randomly reorders the values in any list that is passed to it.\n\n#### Step 3: Create the Answer Options\n\nNow you need to generate the answer options for each question, which will be multiple choice from A to D. You\u2019ll need to create another for loop\u2014this one to generate the content for each of the 50 questions on the quiz. Then there will be a third for loop nested inside to generate the multiple-choice options for each question. Make your code look like the following:\n\n#! python3 # randomQuizGenerator.py - Creates quizzes with questions and answers in # random order, along with the answer key. -- snip -- # Loop through all 50 states, making a question for each. for questionNum in range(50): # Get right and wrong answers. \u278a correctAnswer = capitals[states[questionNum]] \u278b wrongAnswers = list(capitals.values()) \u278c del wrongAnswers[wrongAnswers.index(correctAnswer)] \u278d wrongAnswers = random.sample(wrongAnswers, 3) \u278e answerOptions = wrongAnswers + [correctAnswer] \u278f random.shuffle(answerOptions) # TODO: Write the question and answer options to the quiz file. # TODO: Write the answer key to a file.\n\nThe correct answer is easy to get\u2014it\u2019s stored as a value in the capitals dictionary \u278a . This loop will loop through the states in the shuffled states list, from states[0] to states[49] , find each state in capitals , and store that state\u2019s corresponding capital in correctAnswer .\n\nThe list of possible wrong answers is trickier. You can get it by duplicating all the values in the capitals dictionary \u278b , deleting the correct answer \u278c , and selecting three random values from this list \u278d . The random.sample() function makes it easy to do this selection. Its first argument is the list you want to select from; the second argument is the number of values you want to select. The full list of answer options is the combination of these three wrong answers with the correct answers \u278e . Finally, the answers need to be randomized \u278f so that the correct response isn\u2019t always choice D.\n\n#### Step 4: Write Content to the Quiz and Answer Key Files\n\nAll that is left is to write the question to the quiz file and the answer to the answer key file. Make your code look like the following:\n\n#! python3 # randomQuizGenerator.py - Creates quizzes with questions and answers in # random order, along with the answer key. -- snip -- # Loop through all 50 states, making a question for each. for questionNum in range(50): -- snip -- # Write the question and the answer options to the quiz file. quizFile.write(f'{questionNum + 1}. What is the capital of {states[questionNum]}?\\n') \u278a for i in range(4): \u278b quizFile.write(f\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0{'ABCD'[i]}. { answerOptions[i]}\\n\") quizFile.write('\\n') # Write the answer key to a file. \u278c answerKeyFile.write(f\"{questionNum + 1}. {'ABCD'[answerOptions.index(correctAnswer)]}\") quizFile.close() answerKeyFile.close()\n\nA for loop that goes through integers 0 to 3 will write the answer options in the answerOptions list \u278a . The expression 'ABCD'[i] at \u278b treats the string 'ABCD' as an array and will evaluate to 'A' , 'B' , 'C' , and then 'D' on each respective iteration through the loop.\n\nIn the final line \u278c , the expression answerOptions.index(correctAnswer) will find the integer index of the correct answer in the randomly ordered answer options, and 'ABCD'[answerOptions.index(correctAnswer)] will evaluate to the correct answer\u2019s letter to be written to the answer key file.\n\nAfter you run the program, this is how your capitalsquiz1.txt file will look, though of course your questions and answer options may be different from those shown here, depending on the outcome of your random.shuffle() calls:\n\nName: Date: Period: State Capitals Quiz (Form 1) 1. What is the capital of West Virginia? A. Hartford B. Santa Fe C. Harrisburg D. Charleston 2. What is the capital of Colorado? A. Raleigh B. Harrisburg C. Denver D. Lincoln -- snip --\n\nThe corresponding capitalsquiz_answers1.txt text file will look like this:\n\n1. D 2. C 3. A 4. C -- snip --\n\n### Project: Updatable Multi-Clipboard\n\nLet\u2019s rewrite the \u201cmulti-clipboard\u201d program from Chapter 6 so that it uses the shelve module. The user will now be able to save new strings to load to the clipboard without having to modify the source code. We\u2019ll name this new program mcb.pyw (since \u201cmcb\u201d is shorter to type than \u201cmulti-clipboard\u201d). The .pyw extension means that Python won\u2019t show a Terminal window when it runs this program. (See Appendix B for more details.)\n\nThe program will save each piece of clipboard text under a keyword. For example, when you run py mcb.pyw save spam , the current contents of the clipboard will be saved with the keyword spam . This text can later be loaded to the clipboard again by running py mcb.pyw spam . And if the user forgets what keywords they have, they can run py mcb.pyw list to copy a list of all keywords to the clipboard.\n\nHere\u2019s what the program does:\n\n- The command line argument for the keyword is checked.\n- If the argument is save , then the clipboard contents are saved to the keyword.\n- If the argument is list , then all the keywords are copied to the clipboard.\n- Otherwise, the text for the keyword is copied to the clipboard.\n\nThis means the code will need to do the following:\n\n- Read the command line arguments from sys.argv .\n- Read and write to the clipboard.\n- Save and load to a shelf file.\n\nIf you use Windows, you can easily run this script from the Run... window by creating a batch file named mcb.bat with the following content:\n\n@pyw.exe C:\\Python34\\mcb.pyw %*\n\n#### Step 1: Comments and Shelf Setup\n\nLet\u2019s start by making a skeleton script with some comments and basic setup. Make your code look like the following:\n\n#! python3 # mcb.pyw - Saves and loads pieces of text to the clipboard. \u278a # Usage: py.exe mcb.pyw save <keyword> - Saves clipboard to keyword. #\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0py.exe mcb.pyw <keyword> - Loads keyword to clipboard. #\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0py.exe mcb.pyw list - Loads all keywords to clipboard. \u278b import shelve, pyperclip, sys \u278c mcbShelf = shelve.open('mcb') # TODO: Save clipboard content. # TODO: List keywords and load content. mcbShelf.close()\n\nIt\u2019s common practice to put general usage information in comments at the top of the file \u278a . If you ever forget how to run your script, you can always look at these comments for a reminder. Then you import your modules \u278b . Copying and pasting will require the pyperclip module, and reading the command line arguments will require the sys module. The shelve module will also come in handy: Whenever the user wants to save a new piece of clipboard text, you\u2019ll save it to a shelf file. Then, when the user wants to paste the text back to their clipboard, you\u2019ll open the shelf file and load it back into your program. The shelf file will be named with the prefix mcb \u278c .\n\n#### Step 2: Save Clipboard Content with a Keyword\n\nThe program does different things depending on whether the user wants to save text to a keyword, load text into the clipboard, or list all the existing keywords. Let\u2019s deal with that first case. Make your code look like the following:\n\n#! python3 # mcb.pyw - Saves and loads pieces of text to the clipboard. -- snip -- # Save clipboard content. \u278a if len(sys.argv) == 3 and sys.argv[1].lower() == 'save': \u278b mcbShelf[sys.argv[2]] = pyperclip.paste() elif len(sys.argv) == 2: \u278c # TODO: List keywords and load content. mcbShelf.close()\n\nIf the first command line argument (which will always be at index 1 of the sys.argv list) is 'save' \u278a , the second command line argument is the keyword for the current content of the clipboard. The keyword will be used as the key for mcbShelf , and the value will be the text currently on the clipboard \u278b .\n\nIf there is only one command line argument, you will assume it is either 'list' or a keyword to load content onto the clipboard. You will implement that code later. For now, just put a TODO comment there \u278c .\n\n#### Step 3: List Keywords and Load a Keyword\u2019s Content\n\nFinally, let\u2019s implement the two remaining cases: the user wants to load clipboard text in from a keyword, or they want a list of all available keywords. Make your code look like the following:\n\n#! python3 # mcb.pyw - Saves and loads pieces of text to the clipboard. -- snip -- # Save clipboard content. if len(sys.argv) == 3 and sys.argv[1].lower() == 'save': mcbShelf[sys.argv[2]] = pyperclip.paste() elif len(sys.argv) == 2: # List keywords and load content. \u278a if sys.argv[1].lower() == 'list': \u278b pyperclip.copy(str(list(mcbShelf.keys()))) elif sys.argv[1] in mcbShelf: \u278c pyperclip.copy(mcbShelf[sys.argv[1]]) mcbShelf.close()\n\nIf there is only one command line argument, first let\u2019s check whether it\u2019s 'list' \u278a . If so, a string representation of the list of shelf keys will be copied to the clipboard \u278b . The user can paste this list into an open text editor to read it.\n\nOtherwise, you can assume the command line argument is a keyword. If this keyword exists in the mcbShelf shelf as a key, you can load the value onto the clipboard \u278c .\n\nAnd that\u2019s it! Launching this program has different steps depending on what operating system your computer uses. See Appendix B for details.\n\nRecall the password locker program you created in Chapter 6 that stored the passwords in a dictionary. Updating the passwords required changing the source code of the program. This isn\u2019t ideal, because average users don\u2019t feel comfortable changing source code to update their software. Also, every time you modify the source code to a program, you run the risk of accidentally introducing new bugs. By storing the data for a program in a different place than the code, you can make your programs easier for others to use and more resistant to bugs.\n\n### Summary\n\nFiles are organized into folders (also called directories), and a path describes the location of a file. Every program running on your computer has a current working directory, which allows you to specify file paths relative to the current location instead of always typing the full (or absolute) path. The pathlib and os.path modules have many functions for manipulating file paths.\n\nYour programs can also directly interact with the contents of text files. The open() function can open these files to read in their contents as one large string (with the read() method) or as a list of strings (with the readlines() method). The open() function can open files in write or append mode to create new text files or add to existing text files, respectively.\n\nIn previous chapters, you used the clipboard as a way of getting large amounts of text into a program, rather than typing it all in. Now you can have your programs read files directly from the hard drive, which is a big improvement, since files are much less volatile than the clipboard.\n\nIn the next chapter, you will learn how to handle the files themselves, by copying them, deleting them, renaming them, moving them, and more.\n\n### Practice Questions\n\n1. What is a relative path relative to?\n\n2. What does an absolute path start with?\n\n3. What does Path('C:/Users') / 'Al' evaluate to on Windows?\n\n4. What does 'C:/Users' / 'Al' evaluate to on Windows?\n\n5. What do the os.getcwd() and os.chdir() functions do?\n\n6. What are the . and .. folders?\n\n7. In C:\\bacon\\eggs\\spam.txt , which part is the dir name, and which part is the base name?\n\n8. What are the three \u201cmode\u201d arguments that can be passed to the open() function?\n\n9. What happens if an existing file is opened in write mode?\n\n10. What is the difference between the read() and readlines() methods?\n\n11. What data structure does a shelf value resemble?\n\n### Practice Projects\n\nFor practice, design and write the following programs.\n\n#### Extending the Multi-Clipboard\n\nExtend the multi-clipboard program in this chapter so that it has a delete <keyword> command line argument that will delete a keyword from the shelf. Then add a delete command line argument that will delete all keywords.\n\n#### Mad Libs\n\nCreate a Mad Libs program that reads in text files and lets the user add their own text anywhere the word ADJECTIVE , NOUN , ADVERB , or VERB appears in the text file. For example, a text file may look like this:\n\nThe ADJECTIVE panda walked to the NOUN and then VERB. A nearby NOUN was unaffected by these events.\n\nThe program would find these occurrences and prompt the user to replace them.\n\nEnter an adjective: silly Enter a noun: chandelier Enter a verb: screamed Enter a noun: pickup truck\n\nThe following text file would then be created:\n\nThe silly panda walked to the chandelier and then screamed. A nearby pickup truck was unaffected by these events.\n\nThe results should be printed to the screen and saved to a new text file.\n\n#### Regex Search\n\nWrite a program that opens all . txt files in a folder and searches for any line that matches a user-supplied regular expression. The results should be printed to the screen.",
