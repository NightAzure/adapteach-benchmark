Note that a secondary prompt on a\nline by itself in an example means you must type a blank line; this is used to\nend a multi-line command.\n\nYou can use the \u00e2\u0080\u009cCopy\u00e2\u0080\u009d button (it appears in the upper-right corner\nwhen hovering over or tapping a code example), which strips prompts\nand omits output, to copy and paste the input lines into your interpreter.\n\nMany of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive\nprompt, include comments.  Comments in Python start with the hash character, # , and extend to the end of the physical line.  A comment may appear at the\nstart of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string\nliteral.  A hash character within a string literal is just a hash character.\nSince comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted by Python, they may\nbe omitted when typing in examples.\n\nSome examples:\n\n```python\n# this is the first comment\nspam = 1  # and this is the second comment\n          # ... and now a third!\ntext = \"# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes.\"\n```python\n\n## 3.1.Using Python as a Calculator\u00c2\u00b6\n\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s try some simple Python commands.  Start the interpreter and wait for the\nprimary prompt, >>> .  (It shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take long.)\n\n### 3.1.1.Numbers\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression into it\nand it will write the value.  Expression syntax is straightforward: the\noperators + , - , * and / can be used to perform\narithmetic; parentheses ( () ) can be used for grouping.\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> 2 + 2\n4\n>>> 50 - 5*6\n20\n>>> (50 - 5*6) / 4\n5.0\n>>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating-point number\n1.6\n```python\n\nThe integer numbers (e.g. 2 , 4 , 20 ) have type int ,\nthe ones with a fractional part (e.g. 5.0 , 1.6 ) have type float .  We will see more about numeric types later in the tutorial.\n\nDivision ( / ) always returns a float.  To do floor division and\nget an integer result you can use the // operator; to calculate\nthe remainder you can use % :\n\n```python\n>>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float\n5.666666666666667\n>>>\n>>> 17 // 3  # floor division discards the fractional part\n5\n>>> 17 % 3  # the % operator returns the remainder of the division\n2\n>>> 5 * 3 + 2  # floored quotient * divisor + remainder\n17\n```python\n\nWith Python, it is possible to use the ** operator to calculate powers [ 1 ] :\n\n```python\n>>> 5 ** 2  # 5 squared\n25\n>>> 2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7\n128\n```python\n\nThe equal sign ( = ) is used to assign a value to a variable. Afterwards, no\nresult is displayed before the next interactive prompt:\n\n```python\n>>> width = 20\n>>> height = 5 * 9\n>>> width * height\n900\n```python\n\nIf a variable is not \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefined\u00e2\u0080\u009d (assigned a value), trying to use it will\ngive you an error:\n\n```python\n>>> n  # try to access an undefined variable\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nNameError: name 'n' is not defined\n```python\n\nThere is full support for floating point; operators with mixed type operands\nconvert the integer operand to floating point:\n\n```python\n>>> 4 * 3.75 - 1\n14.0\n```python\n\nIn interactive mode, the last printed expression is assigned to the variable _ .  This means that when you are using Python as a desk calculator, it is\nsomewhat easier to continue calculations, for example:\n\n```python\n>>> tax = 12.5 / 100\n>>> price = 100.50\n>>> price * tax\n12.5625\n>>> price + _\n113.0625\n>>> round(_, 2)\n113.06\n```python\n\nThis variable should be treated as read-only by the user.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explicitly\nassign a value to it \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you would create an independent local variable with the\nsame name masking the built-in variable with its magic behavior.\n\nIn addition to int and float , Python supports other types of\nnumbers, such as Decimal and Fraction .\nPython also has built-in support for complex numbers ,\nand uses the j or J suffix to indicate the imaginary part\n(e.g. 3+5j ).\n\n### 3.1.2.Text\u00c2\u00b6\n\nPython can manipulate text (represented by type str , so-called\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cstrings\u00e2\u0080\u009d) as well as numbers.  This includes characters \u00e2\u0080\u009c ! \u00e2\u0080\u009d, words\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c rabbit \u00e2\u0080\u009d, names \u00e2\u0080\u009c Paris \u00e2\u0080\u009d, sentences \u00e2\u0080\u009c Got your back. \u00e2\u0080\u009d, etc.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c Yay! :) \u00e2\u0080\u009d. They can be enclosed in single quotes ( '...' ) or double\nquotes ( \"...\" ) with the same result [ 2 ] .\n\n```python\n>>> 'spam eggs'  # single quotes\n'spam eggs'\n>>> \"Paris rabbit got your back :)! Yay!\"  # double quotes\n'Paris rabbit got your back :)! Yay!'\n>>> '1975'  # digits and numerals enclosed in quotes are also strings\n'1975'\n```python\n\nTo quote a quote, we need to \u00e2\u0080\u009cescape\u00e2\u0080\u009d it, by preceding it with \\ .\nAlternatively, we can use the other type of quotation marks:\n\n```python\n>>> 'doesn\\'t'  # use \\' to escape the single quote...\n\"doesn't\"\n>>> \"doesn't\"  # ...or use double quotes instead\n\"doesn't\"\n>>> '\"Yes,\" they said.'\n'\"Yes,\" they said.'\n>>> \"\\\"Yes,\\\" they said.\"\n'\"Yes,\" they said.'\n>>> '\"Isn\\'t,\" they said.'\n'\"Isn\\'t,\" they said.'\n```python\n\nIn the Python shell, the string definition and output string can look\ndifferent.  The print() function produces a more readable output, by\nomitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and special characters:\n\n```python\n>>> s = 'First line.\\nSecond line.'  # \\n means newline\n>>> s  # without print(), special characters are included in the string\n'First line.\\nSecond line.'\n>>> print(s)  # with print(), special characters are interpreted, so \\n produces new line\nFirst line.\nSecond line.\n```python\n\nIf you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want characters prefaced by \\ to be interpreted as\nspecial characters, you can use raw strings by adding an r before\nthe first quote:\n\n```python\n>>> print('C:\\some\\name')  # here \\n means newline!\nC:\\some\name\n>>> print(r'C:\\some\\name')  # note the r before the quote\nC:\\some\\name\n```python\n\nThere is one subtle aspect to raw strings: a raw string may not end in\nan odd number of \\ characters; see the FAQ entry for more information\nand workarounds.\n\nString literals can span multiple lines.  One way is using triple-quotes: \"\"\"...\"\"\" or '''...''' .  End-of-line characters are automatically\nincluded in the string, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to prevent this by adding a \\ at\nthe end of the line.  In the following example, the initial newline is not\nincluded:\n\n```python\n>>> print(\"\"\"\\\n... Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]\n...      -h                        Display this usage message\n...      -H hostname               Hostname to connect to\n... \"\"\")\nUsage: thingy [OPTIONS]\n     -h                        Display this usage message\n     -H hostname               Hostname to connect to\n\n>>>\n```python\n\nStrings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and\nrepeated with * :\n\n```python\n>>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'\n>>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium'\n'unununium'\n```python\n\nTwo or more string literals (i.e. the ones enclosed between quotes) next\nto each other are automatically concatenated.\n\n```python\n>>> 'Py' 'thon'\n'Python'\n```python\n\nThis feature is particularly useful when you want to break long strings:\n\n```python\n>>> text = ('Put several strings within parentheses '\n...         'to have them joined together.')\n>>> text\n'Put several strings within parentheses to have them joined together.'\n```python\n\nThis only works with two literals though, not with variables or expressions:\n\n```python\n>>> prefix = 'Py'\n>>> prefix 'thon'  # can't concatenate a variable and a string literal\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n    prefix 'thon'\n           ^^^^^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n>>> ('un' * 3) 'ium'\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1\n    ('un' * 3) 'ium'\n               ^^^^^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```python\n\nIf you want to concatenate variables or a variable and a literal, use + :\n\n```python\n>>> prefix + 'thon'\n'Python'\n```python\n\nStrings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character having index 0.\nThere is no separate character type; a character is simply a string of size\none:\n\n```python\n>>> word = 'Python'\n>>> word[0]  # character in position 0\n'P'\n>>> word[5]  # character in position 5\n'n'\n```python\n\nIndices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right:\n\n```python\n>>> word[-1]  # last character\n'n'\n>>> word[-2]  # second-last character\n'o'\n>>> word[-6]\n'P'\n```python\n\nNote that since -0 is the same as 0, negative indices start from -1.\n\nIn addition to indexing, slicing is also supported.  While indexing is used\nto obtain individual characters, slicing allows you to obtain a substring:\n\n```python\n>>> word[0:2]  # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)\n'Py'\n>>> word[2:5]  # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded)\n'tho'\n```python\n\nSlice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults to zero, an\nomitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced.\n\n```python\n>>> word[:2]   # character from the beginning to position 2 (excluded)\n'Py'\n>>> word[4:]   # characters from position 4 (included) to the end\n'on'\n>>> word[-2:]  # characters from the second-last (included) to the end\n'on'\n```python\n\nNote how the start is always included, and the end always excluded.  This\nmakes sure that s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s :\n\n```python\n>>> word[:2] + word[2:]\n'Python'\n>>> word[:4] + word[4:]\n'Python'\n```python\n\nOne way to remember how slices work is to think of the indices as pointing between characters, with the left edge of the first character numbered 0.\nThen the right edge of the last character of a string of n characters has\nindex n , for example:\n\n```python\n +---+---+---+---+---+---+\n | P | y | t | h | o | n |\n +---+---+---+---+---+---+\n 0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n-6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1\n```python\n\nThe first row of numbers gives the position of the indices 0\u00e2\u0080\u00a66 in the string;\nthe second row gives the corresponding negative indices. The slice from i to j consists of all characters between the edges labeled i and j ,\nrespectively.\n\nFor non-negative indices, the length of a slice is the difference of the\nindices, if both are within bounds.  For example, the length of word[1:3] is\n2.\n\nAttempting to use an index that is too large will result in an error:\n\n```python\n>>> word[42]  # the word only has 6 characters\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nIndexError: string index out of range\n```python\n\nHowever, out of range slice indexes are handled gracefully when used for\nslicing:\n\n```python\n>>> word[4:42]\n'on'\n>>> word[42:]\n''\n```python\n\nPython strings cannot be changed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 they are immutable .\nTherefore, assigning to an indexed position in the string results in an error:\n\n```python\n>>> word[0] = 'J'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n>>> word[2:] = 'py'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n```python\n\nIf you need a different string, you should create a new one:\n\n```python\n>>> 'J' + word[1:]\n'Jython'\n>>> word[:2] + 'py'\n'Pypy'\n```python\n\nThe built-in function len() returns the length of a string:\n\n```python\n>>> s = 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'\n>>> len(s)\n34\n```python\n\nSee also\n\nText Sequence Type \u00e2\u0080\u0094 str\nStrings are examples of sequence types , and support the common\noperations supported by such types.\n\nString Methods\nStrings support a large number of methods for\nbasic transformations and searching.\n\nf-strings\nString literals that have embedded expressions.\n\nFormat String Syntax\nInformation about string formatting with str.format() .\n\nprintf-style String Formatting\nThe old formatting operations invoked when strings are\nthe left operand of the % operator are described in more detail here.\n\n### 3.1.3.Lists\u00c2\u00b6\n\nPython knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other\nvalues.  The most versatile is the list , which can be written as a list of\ncomma-separated values (items) between square brackets.  Lists might contain\nitems of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.\n\n```python\n>>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n>>> squares\n[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```python\n\nLike strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be\nindexed and sliced:\n\n```python\n>>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item\n1\n>>> squares[-1]\n25\n>>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new list\n[9, 16, 25]\n```python\n\nLists also support operations like concatenation:\n\n```python\n>>> squares + [36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]\n```python\n\nUnlike strings, which are immutable , lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change their content:\n\n```python\n>>> cubes = [1, 8, 27, 65, 125]  # something's wrong here\n>>> 4 ** 3  # the cube of 4 is 64, not 65!\n64\n>>> cubes[3] = 64  # replace the wrong value\n>>> cubes\n[1, 8, 27, 64, 125]\n```python\n\nYou can also add new items at the end of the list, by using\nthe list.append() method (we will see more about methods later):\n\n```python\n>>> cubes.append(216)  # add the cube of 6\n>>> cubes.append(7 ** 3)  # and the cube of 7\n>>> cubes\n[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343]\n```python\n\nSimple assignment in Python never copies data. When you assign a list\nto a variable, the variable refers to the existing list .\nAny changes you make to the list through one variable will be seen\nthrough all other variables that refer to it.:\n\n```python\n>>> rgb = [\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\"]\n>>> rgba = rgb\n>>> id(rgb) == id(rgba)  # they reference the same object\nTrue\n>>> rgba.append(\"Alph\")\n>>> rgb\n[\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\", \"Alph\"]\n```python\n\nAll slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements.  This\nmeans that the following slice returns a shallow copy of the list:\n\n```python\n>>> correct_rgba = rgba[:]\n>>> correct_rgba[-1] = \"Alpha\"\n>>> correct_rgba\n[\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\", \"Alpha\"]\n>>> rgba\n[\"Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\", \"Alph\"]\n```python\n\nAssignment to slices is also possible, and this can even change the size of the\nlist or clear it entirely:\n\n```python\n>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']\n>>> letters\n['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']\n>>> # replace some values\n>>> letters[2:5] = ['C', 'D', 'E']\n>>> letters\n['a', 'b', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'f', 'g']\n>>> # now remove them\n>>> letters[2:5] = []\n>>> letters\n['a', 'b', 'f', 'g']\n>>> # clear the list by replacing all the elements with an empty list\n>>> letters[:] = []\n>>> letters\n[]\n```python\n\nThe built-in function len() also applies to lists:\n\n```python\n>>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']\n>>> len(letters)\n4\n```python\n\nIt is possible to nest lists (create lists containing other lists), for\nexample:\n\n```python\n>>> a = ['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> n = [1, 2, 3]\n>>> x = [a, n]\n>>> x\n[['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3]]\n>>> x[0]\n['a', 'b', 'c']\n>>> x[0][1]\n'b'\n```python\n\n## 3.2.First Steps Towards Programming\u00c2\u00b6\n\nOf course, we can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two\ntogether.  For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series as follows:\n\n```python\n>>> # Fibonacci series:\n>>> # the sum of two elements defines the next\n>>> a, b = 0, 1\n>>> while a < 10:\n...     print(a)\n...     a, b = b, a+b\n...\n0\n1\n1\n2\n3\n5\n8\n```python\n\nThis example introduces several new features.\n\n- The first line contains a multiple assignment : the variables a and b simultaneously get the new values 0 and 1.  On the last line this is used again,\ndemonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side are all evaluated\nfirst before any of the assignments take place.  The right-hand side expressions\nare evaluated  from the left to the right.\n- The while loop executes as long as the condition (here: a < 10 )\nremains true.  In Python, like in C, any non-zero integer value is true; zero is\nfalse.  The condition may also be a string or list value, in fact any sequence;\nanything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false.  The test\nused in the example is a simple comparison.  The standard comparison operators\nare written the same as in C: < (less than), > (greater than), == (equal to), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to)\nand != (not equal to).\n- The body of the loop is indented : indentation is Python\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way of grouping\nstatements.  At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for\neach indented line.  In practice you will prepare more complicated input\nfor Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent\nfacility.  When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be\nfollowed by a blank line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot\nguess when you have typed the last line).  Note that each line within a basic\nblock must be indented by the same amount.\n- The print() function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given.\nIt differs from just writing the expression you want to write (as we did\nearlier in the calculator examples) in the way it handles multiple arguments,\nfloating-point quantities, and strings.  Strings are printed without quotes,\nand a space is inserted between items, so you can format things nicely, like\nthis: >>> i = 256 * 256 >>> print ( 'The value of i is' , i ) The value of i is 65536 The keyword argument end can be used to avoid the newline after the output,\nor end the output with a different string: >>> a , b = 0 , 1 >>> while a < 1000 : ... print ( a , end = ',' ) ... a , b = b , a + b ... 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,\n\nFootnotes",
