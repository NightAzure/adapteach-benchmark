For example, we\u2019ll find the longest palindromes\nin English and search for words whose letters appear in\nalphabetical order. And I will present another program development\nplan: reduction to a previously solved problem. 9.1\u00a0\u00a0Reading word lists For the exercises in this chapter we need a list of English words.\nThere are lots of word lists available on the Web, but the one most\nsuitable for our purpose is one of the word lists collected and\ncontributed to the public domain by Grady Ward as part of the Moby\nlexicon project (see http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project ). It\nis a list of 113,809 official crosswords; that is, words that are\nconsidered valid in crossword puzzles and other word games. In the\nMoby collection, the filename is 113809of.fic ; you can download\na copy, with the simpler name words.txt , from https://thinkpython.com/code/words.txt . This file is in plain text, so you can open it with a text\neditor, but you can also read it from Python. The built-in\nfunction open takes the name of the file as a parameter\nand returns a file object you can use to read the file. >>> fin = open('words.txt') fin is a common name for a file object used for input. The file\nobject provides several methods for reading, including readline ,\nwhich reads characters from the file until it gets to a newline and\nreturns the result as a string: >>> fin.readline()\n'aa\\n' The first word in this particular list is \u201caa\u201d, which is a kind of\nlava. The sequence \\n represents the newline character that\nseparates this word from the next. The file object keeps track of where it is in the file, so\nif you call readline again, you get the next word: >>> fin.readline()\n'aah\\n' The next word is \u201caah\u201d, which is a perfectly legitimate\nword, so stop looking at me like that.\nOr, if it\u2019s the newline character that\u2019s bothering you,\nwe can get rid of it with the string method strip : >>> line = fin.readline()\n>>> word = line.strip()\n>>> word\n'aahed' You can also use a file object as part of a for loop.\nThis program reads words.txt and prints each word, one\nper line: fin = open('words.txt')\nfor line in fin:\n    word = line.strip()\n    print(word) 9.2\u00a0\u00a0Exercises There are solutions to these exercises in the next section.\nYou should at least attempt each one before you read the solutions. Exercise\u00a01 Write a program that reads words.txt and prints only the\nwords with more than 20 characters (not counting whitespace). Exercise\u00a02 In 1939 Ernest Vincent Wright published a 50,000 word novel called Gadsby that does not contain the letter \u201ce\u201d. Since \u201ce\u201d is\nthe most common letter in English, that\u2019s not easy to do. In fact, it is difficult to construct a solitary thought without using\nthat most common symbol. It is slow going at first, but with caution\nand hours of training you can gradually gain facility. All right, I\u2019ll stop now. Write a function called has_no_e that returns True if\nthe given word doesn\u2019t have the letter \u201ce\u201d in it. Write a program that reads words.txt and prints only the words\nthat have no \u201ce\u201d. Compute the percentage of words in the list\nthat have no \u201ce\u201d. Exercise\u00a03 Write a function named avoids that takes a word and a string of forbidden letters, and\nthat returns True if the word doesn\u2019t use any of the forbidden\nletters. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string\nof forbidden letters and then prints the number of words that\ndon\u2019t contain any of them.\nCan you find a combination of 5 forbidden letters that\nexcludes the smallest number of words? Exercise\u00a04 Write a function named uses_only that takes a word and a\nstring of letters, and that returns True if the word contains\nonly letters in the list. Can you make a sentence using only the\nletters acefhlo ? Other than \u201cHoe alfalfa\u201d? Exercise\u00a05 Write a function named uses_all that takes a word and a\nstring of required letters, and that returns True if the word\nuses all the required letters at least once. How many words are there\nthat use all the vowels aeiou ? How about aeiouy ? Exercise\u00a06 Write a function called is_abecedarian that returns True if the letters in a word appear in alphabetical order\n(double letters are ok).\nHow many abecedarian words are there? 9.3\u00a0\u00a0Search All of the exercises in the previous section have something\nin common; they can be solved with the search pattern we saw\nin Section 8.6 . The simplest example is: def has_no_e(word):\n    for letter in word:\n        if letter == 'e':\n            return False\n    return True The for loop traverses the characters in word . If we find\nthe letter \u201ce\u201d, we can immediately return False ; otherwise we\nhave to go to the next letter. If we exit the loop normally, that\nmeans we didn\u2019t find an \u201ce\u201d, so we return True . You could write this function more concisely using the in operator, but I started with this version because it\ndemonstrates the logic of the search pattern. avoids is a more general version of has_no_e but it\nhas the same structure: def avoids(word, forbidden):\n    for letter in word:\n        if letter in forbidden:\n            return False\n    return True We can return False as soon as we find a forbidden letter;\nif we get to the end of the loop, we return True . uses_only is similar except that the sense of the condition\nis reversed: def uses_only(word, available):\n    for letter in word:\n        if letter not in available:\n            return False\n    return True Instead of a list of forbidden letters, we have a list of available\nletters. If we find a letter in word that is not in available , we can return False . uses_all is similar except that we reverse the role\nof the word and the string of letters: def uses_all(word, required):\n    for letter in required:\n        if letter not in word:\n            return False\n    return True Instead of traversing the letters in word , the loop\ntraverses the required letters. If any of the required letters\ndo not appear in the word, we can return False . If you were really thinking like a computer scientist, you would\nhave recognized that uses_all was an instance of a\npreviously solved problem, and you would have written: def uses_all(word, required):\n    return uses_only(required, word) This is an example of a program development plan called reduction to a previously solved problem , which means that you\nrecognize the problem you are working on as an instance of a solved\nproblem and apply an existing solution. 9.4\u00a0\u00a0Looping with indices I wrote the functions in the previous section with for loops because I only needed the characters in the strings; I didn\u2019t\nhave to do anything with the indices. For is_abecedarian we have to compare adjacent letters,\nwhich is a little tricky with a for loop: def is_abecedarian(word):\n    previous = word[0]\n    for c in word:\n        if c < previous:\n            return False\n        previous = c\n    return True An alternative is to use recursion: def is_abecedarian(word):\n    if len(word) <= 1:\n        return True\n    if word[0] > word[1]:\n        return False\n    return is_abecedarian(word[1:]) Another option is to use a while loop: def is_abecedarian(word):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(word)-1:\n        if word[i+1] < word[i]:\n            return False\n        i = i+1\n    return True The loop starts at i=0 and ends when i=len(word)-1 . Each\ntime through the loop, it compares the i th character (which you can\nthink of as the current character) to the i +1th character (which you\ncan think of as the next). If the next character is less than (alphabetically before) the current\none, then we have discovered a break in the abecedarian trend, and\nwe return False . If we get to the end of the loop without finding a fault, then the\nword passes the test. To convince yourself that the loop ends\ncorrectly, consider an example like 'flossy' . The\nlength of the word is 6, so\nthe last time the loop runs is when i is 4, which is the\nindex of the second-to-last character. On the last iteration,\nit compares the second-to-last character to the last, which is\nwhat we want. Here is a version of is_palindrome (see\nExercise 3 ) that uses two indices; one starts at the\nbeginning and goes up; the other starts at the end and goes down. def is_palindrome(word):\n    i = 0\n    j = len(word)-1\n\n    while i<j:\n        if word[i] != word[j]:\n            return False\n        i = i+1\n        j = j-1\n\n    return True Or we could reduce to a previously solved\nproblem and write: def is_palindrome(word):\n    return is_reverse(word, word) Using is_reverse from Section 8.11 . 9.5\u00a0\u00a0Debugging Testing programs is hard. The functions in this chapter are\nrelatively easy to test because you can check the results by hand.\nEven so, it is somewhere between difficult and impossible to choose a\nset of words that test for all possible errors. Taking has_no_e as an example, there are two obvious\ncases to check: words that have an \u2018e\u2019 should return False , and\nwords that don\u2019t should return True . You should have no\ntrouble coming up with one of each. Within each case, there are some less obvious subcases. Among the\nwords that have an \u201ce\u201d, you should test words with an \u201ce\u201d at the\nbeginning, the end, and somewhere in the middle. You should test long\nwords, short words, and very short words, like the empty string. The\nempty string is an example of a special case , which is one of\nthe non-obvious cases where errors often lurk. In addition to the test cases you generate, you can also test\nyour program with a word list like words.txt . By scanning\nthe output, you might be able to catch errors, but be careful:\nyou might catch one kind of error (words that should not be\nincluded, but are) and not another (words that should be included,\nbut aren\u2019t). In general, testing can help you find bugs, but it is not easy to\ngenerate a good set of test cases, and even if you do, you can\u2019t\nbe sure your program is correct.\nAccording to a legendary computer scientist: Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to\nshow their absence! \u2014 Edsger W. Dijkstra 9.6\u00a0\u00a0Glossary file object: A value that represents an open file. reduction to a previously solved problem: A way of solving a\nproblem by expressing it as an instance of a previously solved\nproblem. special case: A test case that is atypical or non-obvious\n(and less likely to be handled correctly). 9.7\u00a0\u00a0Exercises Exercise\u00a07 This question is based on a Puzzler that was broadcast on the radio\nprogram Car Talk ( http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers ): Give me a word with three consecutive double letters. I\u2019ll give you a\ncouple of words that almost qualify, but don\u2019t. For example, the word\ncommittee, c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. It would be great except for the \u2018i\u2019 that\nsneaks in there. Or Mississippi: M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i. If you could\ntake out those i\u2019s it would work. But there is a word that has three\nconsecutive pairs of letters and to the best of my knowledge this may\nbe the only word. Of course there are probably 500 more but I can only\nthink of one. What is the word? Write a program to find it.\nSolution: https://thinkpython.com/code/cartalk1.py . Exercise\u00a08 Here\u2019s another Car Talk Puzzler ( http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers ): \u201cI was driving on the highway the other day and I happened to\nnotice my odometer. Like most odometers, it shows six digits,\nin whole miles only. So, if my car had 300,000\nmiles, for example, I\u2019d see 3-0-0-0-0-0. \u201cNow, what I saw that day was very interesting. I noticed that the\nlast 4 digits were palindromic; that is, they read the same forward as\nbackward. For example, 5-4-4-5 is a palindrome, so my odometer\ncould have read 3-1-5-4-4-5. \u201cOne mile later, the last 5 numbers were palindromic. For example, it\ncould have read 3-6-5-4-5-6. One mile after that, the middle 4 out of\n6 numbers were palindromic. And you ready for this? One mile later,\nall 6 were palindromic! \u201cThe question is, what was on the odometer when I first looked?\u201d Write a Python program that tests all the six-digit numbers and prints\nany numbers that satisfy these requirements.\nSolution: https://thinkpython.com/code/cartalk2.py . Exercise\u00a09 Here\u2019s another Car Talk Puzzler you can solve with a\nsearch ( http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers ): \u201cRecently I had a visit with my mom and we realized that\nthe two digits that make up my age when reversed resulted in her\nage. For example, if she\u2019s 73, I\u2019m 37. We wondered how often this has\nhappened over the years but we got sidetracked with other topics and\nwe never came up with an answer. \u201cWhen I got home I figured out that the digits of our ages have been\nreversible six times so far. I also figured out that if we\u2019re lucky it\nwould happen again in a few years, and if we\u2019re really lucky it would\nhappen one more time after that. In other words, it would have\nhappened 8 times over all. So the question is, how old am I now?\u201d Write a Python program that searches for solutions to this Puzzler.\nHint: you might find the string method zfill useful.
