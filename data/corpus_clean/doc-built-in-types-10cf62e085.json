  "content": "# Built-in Types\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe following sections describe the standard types that are built into the\ninterpreter.\n\nThe principal built-in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes,\ninstances and exceptions.\n\nSome collection classes are mutable.  The methods that add, subtract, or\nrearrange their members in place, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t return a specific item, never return\nthe collection instance itself but None .\n\nSome operations are supported by several object types; in particular,\npractically all objects can be compared for equality, tested for truth\nvalue, and converted to a string (with the repr() function or the\nslightly different str() function).  The latter function is implicitly\nused when an object is written by the print() function.\n\n## Truth Value Testing\u00c2\u00b6\n\nAny object can be tested for truth value, for use in an if or while condition or as operand of the Boolean operations below.\n\nBy default, an object is considered true unless its class defines either a __bool__() method that returns False or a __len__() method that\nreturns zero, when called with the object. [ 1 ] If one of the methods raises an\nexception when called, the exception is propagated and the object does\nnot have a truth value (for example, NotImplemented ).\nHere are most of the built-in objects considered false:\n\n- constants defined to be false: None and False\n- zero of any numeric type: 0 , 0.0 , 0j , Decimal(0) , Fraction(0, 1)\n- empty sequences and collections: '' , () , [] , {} , set() , range(0)\n\nOperations and built-in functions that have a Boolean result always return 0 or False for false and 1 or True for true, unless otherwise stated.\n(Important exception: the Boolean operations or and and always return\none of their operands.)\n\n## Boolean Operations \u00e2\u0080\u0094and,or,not\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThese are the Boolean operations, ordered by ascending priority:\n\nNotes:\n\n- This is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second\nargument if the first one is false.\n- This is a short-circuit operator, so it only evaluates the second\nargument if the first one is true.\n- not has a lower priority than non-Boolean operators, so not a == b is\ninterpreted as not (a == b) , and a == not b is a syntax error.\n\n## Comparisons\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThere are eight comparison operations in Python.  They all have the same\npriority (which is higher than that of the Boolean operations).  Comparisons can\nbe chained arbitrarily; for example, x < y <= z is equivalent to x < y and y <= z , except that y is evaluated only once (but in both cases z is not\nevaluated at all when x < y is found to be false).\n\nThis table summarizes the comparison operations:\n\nUnless stated otherwise, objects of different types never compare equal.\nThe == operator is always defined but for some object types (for example,\nclass objects) is equivalent to is . The < , <= , > and >= operators are only defined where they make sense; for example, they raise a TypeError exception when one of the arguments is a complex number.\n\nNon-identical instances of a class normally compare as non-equal unless the\nclass defines the __eq__() method.\n\nInstances of a class cannot be ordered with respect to other instances of the\nsame class, or other types of object, unless the class defines enough of the\nmethods __lt__() , __le__() , __gt__() , and __ge__() (in general, __lt__() and __eq__() are sufficient, if you want the conventional meanings of the\ncomparison operators).\n\nThe behavior of the is and is not operators cannot be\ncustomized; also they can be applied to any two objects and never raise an\nexception.\n\nTwo more operations with the same syntactic priority, in and not in , are supported by types that are iterable or\nimplement the __contains__() method.\n\n## Numeric Types \u00e2\u0080\u0094int,float,complex\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThere are three distinct numeric types: integers , floating-point\nnumbers , and complex numbers .  In addition, Booleans are a\nsubtype of integers.  Integers have unlimited precision.  Floating-point\nnumbers are usually implemented using double in C; information\nabout the precision and internal representation of floating-point\nnumbers for the machine on which your program is running is available\nin sys.float_info .  Complex numbers have a real and imaginary\npart, which are each a floating-point number.  To extract these parts\nfrom a complex number z , use z.real and z.imag . (The standard\nlibrary includes the additional numeric types fractions.Fraction , for\nrationals, and decimal.Decimal , for floating-point numbers with\nuser-definable precision.)\n\nNumbers are created by numeric literals or as the result of built-in functions\nand operators.  Unadorned integer literals (including hex, octal and binary\nnumbers) yield integers.  Numeric literals containing a decimal point or an\nexponent sign yield floating-point numbers.  Appending 'j' or 'J' to a\nnumeric literal yields an imaginary number (a complex number with a zero real\npart) which you can add to an integer or float to get a complex number with real\nand imaginary parts.\n\nThe constructors int() , float() , and complex() can be used to produce numbers of a specific type.\n\nPython fully supports mixed arithmetic: when a binary arithmetic operator has\noperands of different built-in numeric types, the operand with the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnarrower\u00e2\u0080\u009d\ntype is widened to that of the other:\n\n- If both arguments are complex numbers, no conversion is performed;\n- if either argument is a complex or a floating-point number, the other is\nconverted to a floating-point number;\n- otherwise, both must be integers and no conversion is necessary.\n\nArithmetic with complex and real operands is defined by the usual mathematical\nformula, for example:\n\n```python\nx + complex(u, v) = complex(x + u, v)\nx * complex(u, v) = complex(x * u, x * v)\n```python\n\nA comparison between numbers of different types behaves as though the exact\nvalues of those numbers were being compared. [ 2 ]\n\nAll numeric types (except complex) support the following operations (for priorities of\nthe operations, see Operator precedence ):\n\nNotes:\n\n- Also referred to as integer division.  For operands of type int ,\nthe result has type int .  For operands of type float ,\nthe result has type float .  In general, the result is a whole\ninteger, though the result\u00e2\u0080\u0099s type is not necessarily int .  The result is\nalways rounded towards minus infinity: 1//2 is 0 , (-1)//2 is -1 , 1//(-2) is -1 , and (-1)//(-2) is 0 .\n- Not for complex numbers.  Instead convert to floats using abs() if\nappropriate.\n- Conversion from float to int truncates, discarding the\nfractional part. See functions math.floor() and math.ceil() for\nalternative conversions.\n- float also accepts the strings \u00e2\u0080\u009cnan\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cinf\u00e2\u0080\u009d with an optional prefix \u00e2\u0080\u009c+\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nor \u00e2\u0080\u009c-\u00e2\u0080\u009d for Not a Number (NaN) and positive or negative infinity.\n- Python defines pow(0, 0) and 0 ** 0 to be 1 , as is common for\nprogramming languages.\n- The numeric literals accepted include the digits 0 to 9 or any\nUnicode equivalent (code points with the Nd property). See the Unicode Standard for a complete list of code points with the Nd property.\n\nAll numbers.Real types ( int and float ) also include\nthe following operations:\n\nFor additional numeric operations see the math and cmath modules.\n\n### Bitwise Operations on Integer Types\u00c2\u00b6\n\nBitwise operations only make sense for integers. The result of bitwise\noperations is calculated as though carried out in two\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complement with an\ninfinite number of sign bits.\n\nThe priorities of the binary bitwise operations are all lower than the numeric\noperations and higher than the comparisons; the unary operation ~ has the\nsame priority as the other unary numeric operations ( + and - ).\n\nThis table lists the bitwise operations sorted in ascending priority:\n\nNotes:\n\n- Negative shift counts are illegal and cause a ValueError to be raised.\n- A left shift by n bits is equivalent to multiplication by pow(2, n) .\n- A right shift by n bits is equivalent to floor division by pow(2, n) .\n- Performing these calculations with at least one extra sign extension bit in\na finite two\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complement representation (a working bit-width of 1 + max(x.bit_length(), y.bit_length()) or more) is sufficient to get the\nsame result as if there were an infinite number of sign bits.\n\n### Additional Methods on Integer Types\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe int type implements the numbers.Integral abstract base\nclass . In addition, it provides a few more methods:\n\nint.\nbit_length\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the number of bits necessary to represent an integer in binary,\nexcluding the sign and leading zeros:\n\n```python\n>>> n = -37\n>>> bin(n)\n'-0b100101'\n>>> n.bit_length()\n6\n```python\n\nMore precisely, if x is nonzero, then x.bit_length() is the\nunique positive integer k such that 2**(k-1) <= abs(x) < 2**k .\nEquivalently, when abs(x) is small enough to have a correctly\nrounded logarithm, then k = 1 + int(log(abs(x), 2)) .\nIf x is zero, then x.bit_length() returns 0 .\n\nEquivalent to:\n\n```python\ndef bit_length(self):\n    s = bin(self)       # binary representation:  bin(-37) --> '-0b100101'\n    s = s.lstrip('-0b') # remove leading zeros and minus sign\n    return len(s)       # len('100101') --> 6\n```python\n\nAdded in version 3.1.\n\nint.\nbit_count\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the number of ones in the binary representation of the absolute\nvalue of the integer. This is also known as the population count.\nExample:\n\n```python\n>>> n = 19\n>>> bin(n)\n'0b10011'\n>>> n.bit_count()\n3\n>>> (-n).bit_count()\n3\n```python\n\nEquivalent to:\n\n```python\ndef bit_count(self):\n    return bin(self).count(\"1\")\n```python\n\nAdded in version 3.10.\n\nint.\nto_bytes\n(\nlength\n=\n1\n,\nbyteorder\n=\n'big'\n,\n*\n,\nsigned\n=\nFalse\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn an array of bytes representing an integer.\n\n```python\n>>> (1024).to_bytes(2, byteorder='big')\nb'\\x04\\x00'\n>>> (1024).to_bytes(10, byteorder='big')\nb'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x04\\x00'\n>>> (-1024).to_bytes(10, byteorder='big', signed=True)\nb'\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xfc\\x00'\n>>> x = 1000\n>>> x.to_bytes((x.bit_length() + 7) // 8, byteorder='little')\nb'\\xe8\\x03'\n```python\n\nThe integer is represented using length bytes, and defaults to 1.  An OverflowError is raised if the integer is not representable with\nthe given number of bytes.\n\nThe byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the\ninteger, and defaults to \"big\" .  If byteorder is \"big\" , the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte\narray.  If byteorder is \"little\" , the most significant byte is at\nthe end of the byte array.\n\nThe signed argument determines whether two\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complement is used to\nrepresent the integer.  If signed is False and a negative integer is\ngiven, an OverflowError is raised. The default value for signed is False .\n\nThe default values can be used to conveniently turn an integer into a\nsingle byte object:\n\n```python\n>>> (65).to_bytes()\nb'A'\n```python\n\nHowever, when using the default arguments, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try\nto convert a value greater than 255 or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get an OverflowError .\n\nEquivalent to:\n\n```python\ndef to_bytes(n, length=1, byteorder='big', signed=False):\n    if byteorder == 'little':\n        order = range(length)\n    elif byteorder == 'big':\n        order = reversed(range(length))\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"byteorder must be either 'little' or 'big'\")\n\n    return bytes((n >> i*8) & 0xff for i in order)\n```python\n\nAdded in version 3.2.\n\nChanged in version 3.11: Added default argument values for length and byteorder .\n\nclassmethod\nint.\nfrom_bytes\n(\nbytes\n,\nbyteorder\n=\n'big'\n,\n*\n,\nsigned\n=\nFalse\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the integer represented by the given array of bytes.\n\n```python\n>>> int.from_bytes(b'\\x00\\x10', byteorder='big')\n16\n>>> int.from_bytes(b'\\x00\\x10', byteorder='little')\n4096\n>>> int.from_bytes(b'\\xfc\\x00', byteorder='big', signed=True)\n-1024\n>>> int.from_bytes(b'\\xfc\\x00', byteorder='big', signed=False)\n64512\n>>> int.from_bytes([255, 0, 0], byteorder='big')\n16711680\n```python\n\nThe argument bytes must either be a bytes-like object or an\niterable producing bytes.\n\nThe byteorder argument determines the byte order used to represent the\ninteger, and defaults to \"big\" .  If byteorder is \"big\" , the most significant byte is at the beginning of the byte\narray.  If byteorder is \"little\" , the most significant byte is at\nthe end of the byte array.  To request the native byte order of the host\nsystem, use sys.byteorder as the byte order value.\n\nThe signed argument indicates whether two\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complement is used to\nrepresent the integer.\n\nEquivalent to:\n\n```python\ndef from_bytes(bytes, byteorder='big', signed=False):\n    if byteorder == 'little':\n        little_ordered = list(bytes)\n    elif byteorder == 'big':\n        little_ordered = list(reversed(bytes))\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"byteorder must be either 'little' or 'big'\")\n\n    n = sum(b << i*8 for i, b in enumerate(little_ordered))\n    if signed and little_ordered and (little_ordered[-1] & 0x80):\n        n -= 1 << 8*len(little_ordered)\n\n    return n\n```python\n\nAdded in version 3.2.\n\nChanged in version 3.11: Added default argument value for byteorder .\n\nint.\nas_integer_ratio\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a pair of integers whose ratio is equal to the original\ninteger and has a positive denominator.  The integer ratio of integers\n(whole numbers) is always the integer as the numerator and 1 as the\ndenominator.\n\nAdded in version 3.8.\n\nint.\nis_integer\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturns True . Exists for duck type compatibility with float.is_integer() .\n\nAdded in version 3.12.\n\n### Additional Methods on Float\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe float type implements the numbers.Real abstract base\nclass . float also has the following additional methods.\n\nclassmethod\nfloat.\nfrom_number\n(\nx\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nClass method to return a floating-point number constructed from a number x .\n\nIf the argument is an integer or a floating-point number, a\nfloating-point number with the same value (within Python\u00e2\u0080\u0099s floating-point\nprecision) is returned.  If the argument is outside the range of a Python\nfloat, an OverflowError will be raised.\n\nFor a general Python object x , float.from_number(x) delegates to x.__float__() .\nIf __float__() is not defined then it falls back\nto __index__() .\n\nAdded in version 3.14.\n\nfloat.\nas_integer_ratio\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a pair of integers whose ratio is exactly equal to the\noriginal float. The ratio is in lowest terms and has a positive denominator.  Raises OverflowError on infinities and a ValueError on\nNaNs.\n\nfloat.\nis_integer\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if the float instance is finite with integral\nvalue, and False otherwise:\n\n```python\n>>> (-2.0).is_integer()\nTrue\n>>> (3.2).is_integer()\nFalse\n```python\n\nTwo methods support conversion to\nand from hexadecimal strings.  Since Python\u00e2\u0080\u0099s floats are stored\ninternally as binary numbers, converting a float to or from a decimal string usually involves a small rounding error.  In\ncontrast, hexadecimal strings allow exact representation and\nspecification of floating-point numbers.  This can be useful when\ndebugging, and in numerical work.\n\nfloat.\nhex\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a representation of a floating-point number as a hexadecimal\nstring.  For finite floating-point numbers, this representation\nwill always include a leading 0x and a trailing p and\nexponent.\n\nclassmethod\nfloat.\nfromhex\n(\ns\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nClass method to return the float represented by a hexadecimal\nstring s .  The string s may have leading and trailing\nwhitespace.\n\nNote that float.hex() is an instance method, while float.fromhex() is a class method.\n\nA hexadecimal string takes the form:\n\n```python\n[sign] ['0x'] integer ['.' fraction] ['p' exponent]\n```python\n\nwhere the optional sign may by either + or - , integer and fraction are strings of hexadecimal digits, and exponent is a decimal integer with an optional leading sign.  Case is not\nsignificant, and there must be at least one hexadecimal digit in\neither the integer or the fraction.  This syntax is similar to the\nsyntax specified in section 6.4.4.2 of the C99 standard, and also to\nthe syntax used in Java 1.5 onwards.  In particular, the output of float.hex() is usable as a hexadecimal floating-point literal in\nC or Java code, and hexadecimal strings produced by C\u00e2\u0080\u0099s %a format\ncharacter or Java\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Double.toHexString are accepted by float.fromhex() .\n\nNote that the exponent is written in decimal rather than hexadecimal,\nand that it gives the power of 2 by which to multiply the coefficient.\nFor example, the hexadecimal string 0x3.a7p10 represents the\nfloating-point number (3 + 10./16 + 7./16**2) * 2.0**10 , or 3740.0 :\n\n```python\n>>> float.fromhex('0x3.a7p10')\n3740.0\n```python\n\nApplying the reverse conversion to 3740.0 gives a different\nhexadecimal string representing the same number:\n\n```python\n>>> float.hex(3740.0)\n'0x1.d380000000000p+11'\n```python\n\n### Additional Methods on Complex\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe complex type implements the numbers.Complex abstract base class . complex also has the following additional methods.\n\nclassmethod\ncomplex.\nfrom_number\n(\nx\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nClass method to convert a number to a complex number.\n\nFor a general Python object x , complex.from_number(x) delegates to x.__complex__() .  If __complex__() is not defined then it falls back\nto __float__() .  If __float__() is not defined then it falls back\nto __index__() .\n\nAdded in version 3.14.\n\n### Hashing of numeric types\u00c2\u00b6\n\nFor numbers x and y , possibly of different types, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a requirement\nthat hash(x) == hash(y) whenever x == y (see the __hash__() method documentation for more details).  For ease of implementation and\nefficiency across a variety of numeric types (including int , float , decimal.Decimal and fractions.Fraction )\nPython\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hash for numeric types is based on a single mathematical function\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s defined for any rational number, and hence applies to all instances of int and fractions.Fraction , and all finite instances of float and decimal.Decimal .  Essentially, this function is\ngiven by reduction modulo P for a fixed prime P .  The value of P is\nmade available to Python as the modulus attribute of sys.hash_info .\n\nCPython implementation detail: Currently, the prime used is P = 2**31 - 1 on machines with 32-bit C\nlongs and P = 2**61 - 1 on machines with 64-bit C longs.\n\nHere are the rules in detail:\n\n- If x = m / n is a nonnegative rational number and n is not divisible\nby P , define hash(x) as m * invmod(n, P) % P , where invmod(n, P) gives the inverse of n modulo P .\n- If x = m / n is a nonnegative rational number and n is\ndivisible by P (but m is not) then n has no inverse\nmodulo P and the rule above doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t apply; in this case define hash(x) to be the constant value sys.hash_info.inf .\n- If x = m / n is a negative rational number define hash(x) as -hash(-x) .  If the resulting hash is -1 , replace it with -2 .\n- The particular values sys.hash_info.inf and -sys.hash_info.inf are used as hash values for positive\ninfinity or negative infinity (respectively).\n- For a complex number z , the hash values of the real\nand imaginary parts are combined by computing hash(z.real) + sys.hash_info.imag * hash(z.imag) , reduced modulo 2**sys.hash_info.width so that it lies in range(-2**(sys.hash_info.width - 1), 2**(sys.hash_info.width - 1)) .  Again, if the result is -1 , it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s replaced with -2 .\n\nTo clarify the above rules, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some example Python code,\nequivalent to the built-in hash, for computing the hash of a rational\nnumber, float , or complex :\n\n```python\nimport sys, math\n\ndef hash_fraction(m, n):\n    \"\"\"Compute the hash of a rational number m / n.\n\n    Assumes m and n are integers, with n positive.\n    Equivalent to hash(fractions.Fraction(m, n)).\n\n    \"\"\"\n    P = sys.hash_info.modulus\n    # Remove common factors of P.  (Unnecessary if m and n already coprime.)\n    while m % P == n % P == 0:\n        m, n = m // P, n // P\n\n    if n % P == 0:\n        hash_value = sys.hash_info.inf\n    else:\n        # Fermat's Little Theorem: pow(n, P-1, P) is 1, so\n        # pow(n, P-2, P) gives the inverse of n modulo P.\n        hash_value = (abs(m) % P) * pow(n, P - 2, P) % P\n    if m < 0:\n        hash_value = -hash_value\n    if hash_value == -1:\n        hash_value = -2\n    return hash_value\n\ndef hash_float(x):\n    \"\"\"Compute the hash of a float x.\"\"\"\n\n    if math.isnan(x):\n        return object.__hash__(x)\n    elif math.isinf(x):\n        return sys.hash_info.inf if x > 0 else -sys.hash_info.inf\n    else:\n        return hash_fraction(*x.as_integer_ratio())\n\ndef hash_complex(z):\n    \"\"\"Compute the hash of a complex number z.\"\"\"\n\n    hash_value = hash_float(z.real) + sys.hash_info.imag * hash_float(z.imag)\n    # do a signed reduction modulo 2**sys.hash_info.width\n    M = 2**(sys.hash_info.width - 1)\n    hash_value = (hash_value & (M - 1)) - (hash_value & M)\n    if hash_value == -1:\n        hash_value = -2\n    return hash_value\n```python\n\n## Boolean Type -bool\u00c2\u00b6\n\nBooleans represent truth values. The bool type has exactly two\nconstant instances: True and False .\n\nThe built-in function bool() converts any value to a boolean, if the\nvalue can be interpreted as a truth value (see section Truth Value Testing above).\n\nFor logical operations, use the boolean operators and , or and not .\nWhen applying the bitwise operators & , | , ^ to two booleans, they\nreturn a bool equivalent to the logical operations \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cor\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cxor\u00e2\u0080\u009d. However,\nthe logical operators and , or and != should be preferred\nover & , | and ^ .\n\nDeprecated since version 3.12: The use of the bitwise inversion operator ~ is deprecated and will\nraise an error in Python 3.16.\n\nbool is a subclass of int (see Numeric Types \u00e2\u0080\u0094 int, float, complex ). In\nmany numeric contexts, False and True behave like the integers 0 and 1, respectively.\nHowever, relying on this is discouraged; explicitly convert using int() instead.\n\n## Iterator Types\u00c2\u00b6\n\nPython supports a concept of iteration over containers.  This is implemented\nusing two distinct methods; these are used to allow user-defined classes to\nsupport iteration.  Sequences, described below in more detail, always support\nthe iteration methods.\n\nOne method needs to be defined for container objects to provide iterable support:\n\ncontainer.\n__iter__\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn an iterator object.  The object is required to support the\niterator protocol described below.  If a container supports different types\nof iteration, additional methods can be provided to specifically request\niterators for those iteration types.  (An example of an object supporting\nmultiple forms of iteration would be a tree structure which supports both\nbreadth-first and depth-first traversal.)  This method corresponds to the tp_iter slot of the type structure for Python\nobjects in the Python/C API.\n\nThe iterator objects themselves are required to support the following two\nmethods, which together form the iterator protocol :\n\niterator.\n__iter__\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the iterator object itself.  This is required to allow both\ncontainers and iterators to be used with the for and in statements.  This method corresponds to the tp_iter slot of the type structure for Python\nobjects in the Python/C API.\n\niterator.\n__next__\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the next item from the iterator .  If there are no further\nitems, raise the StopIteration exception.  This method corresponds to\nthe tp_iternext slot of the type structure for\nPython objects in the Python/C API.\n\nPython defines several iterator objects to support iteration over general and\nspecific sequence types, dictionaries, and other more specialized forms.  The\nspecific types are not important beyond their implementation of the iterator\nprotocol.\n\nOnce an iterator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s __next__() method raises StopIteration , it must continue to do so on subsequent calls.\nImplementations that do not obey this property are deemed broken.\n\n### Generator Types\u00c2\u00b6\n\nPython\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generator s provide a convenient way to implement the iterator\nprotocol.  If a container object\u00e2\u0080\u0099s __iter__() method is implemented as a\ngenerator, it will automatically return an iterator object (technically, a\ngenerator object) supplying the __iter__() and __next__() methods.\nMore information about generators can be found in the documentation for\nthe yield expression .\n\n## Sequence Types \u00e2\u0080\u0094list,tuple,range\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThere are three basic sequence types: lists, tuples, and range objects.\nAdditional sequence types tailored for processing of binary data and text strings are\ndescribed in dedicated sections.\n\n### Common Sequence Operations\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe operations in the following table are supported by most sequence types,\nboth mutable and immutable. The collections.abc.Sequence ABC is\nprovided to make it easier to correctly implement these operations on\ncustom sequence types.\n\nThis table lists the sequence operations sorted in ascending priority.  In the\ntable, s and t are sequences of the same type, n , i , j and k are\nintegers and x is an arbitrary object that meets any type and value\nrestrictions imposed by s .\n\nThe in and not in operations have the same priorities as the\ncomparison operations. The + (concatenation) and * (repetition)\noperations have the same priority as the corresponding numeric operations. [ 3 ]\n\nSequences of the same type also support comparisons.  In particular, tuples\nand lists are compared lexicographically by comparing corresponding elements.\nThis means that to compare equal, every element must compare equal and the\ntwo sequences must be of the same type and have the same length.  (For full\ndetails see Comparisons in the language reference.)\n\nForward and reversed iterators over mutable sequences access values using an\nindex.  That index will continue to march forward (or backward) even if the\nunderlying sequence is mutated.  The iterator terminates only when an IndexError or a StopIteration is encountered (or when the index\ndrops below zero).\n\nNotes:\n\n- While the in and not in operations are used only for simple\ncontainment testing in the general case, some specialised sequences\n(such as str , bytes and bytearray ) also use\nthem for subsequence testing: >>> \"gg\" in \"eggs\" True\n- Values of n less than 0 are treated as 0 (which yields an empty\nsequence of the same type as s ).  Note that items in the sequence s are not copied; they are referenced multiple times.  This often haunts\nnew Python programmers; consider: >>> lists = [[]] * 3 >>> lists [[], [], []] >>> lists [ 0 ] . append ( 3 ) >>> lists [[3], [3], [3]] What has happened is that [[]] is a one-element list containing an empty\nlist, so all three elements of [[]] * 3 are references to this single empty\nlist.  Modifying any of the elements of lists modifies this single list.\nYou can create a list of different lists this way: >>> lists = [[] for i in range ( 3 )] >>> lists [ 0 ] . append ( 3 ) >>> lists [ 1 ] . append ( 5 ) >>> lists [ 2 ] . append ( 7 ) >>> lists [[3], [5], [7]] Further explanation is available in the FAQ entry How do I create a multidimensional list? .\n- If i or j is negative, the index is relative to the end of sequence s : len(s) + i or len(s) + j is substituted.  But note that -0 is\nstill 0 .\n- The slice of s from i to j is defined as the sequence of items with\nindex k such that i <= k < j . If i is omitted or None , use 0 . If j is omitted or None , use len(s) . If i or j is less than -len(s) , use 0 . If i or j is greater than len(s) , use len(s) . If i is greater than or equal to j , the slice is empty.\n- The slice of s from i to j with step k is defined as the sequence of\nitems with index x = i + n*k such that 0 <= n < (j-i)/k .  In other words,\nthe indices are i , i+k , i+2*k , i+3*k and so on, stopping when j is reached (but never including j ).  When k is positive, i and j are reduced to len(s) if they are greater.\nWhen k is negative, i and j are reduced to len(s) - 1 if\nthey are greater.  If i or j are omitted or None , they become\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cend\u00e2\u0080\u009d values (which end depends on the sign of k ).  Note, k cannot be zero.\nIf k is None , it is treated like 1 .\n- Concatenating immutable sequences always results in a new object.  This\nmeans that building up a sequence by repeated concatenation will have a\nquadratic runtime cost in the total sequence length.  To get a linear\nruntime cost, you must switch to one of the alternatives below: if concatenating str objects, you can build a list and use str.join() at the end or else write to an io.StringIO instance and retrieve its value when complete if concatenating bytes objects, you can similarly use bytes.join() or io.BytesIO , or you can do in-place\nconcatenation with a bytearray object. bytearray objects are mutable and have an efficient overallocation mechanism if concatenating tuple objects, extend a list instead for other types, investigate the relevant class documentation\n- Some sequence types (such as range ) only support item sequences\nthat follow specific patterns, and hence don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support sequence\nconcatenation or repetition.\n- An IndexError is raised if i is outside the sequence range.\n\nSequence Methods\n\nSequence types also support the following methods:\n\nsequence.\ncount\n(\nvalue\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the total number of occurrences of value in sequence .\n\nsequence.\nindex\n(\nvalue[,\nstart[,\nstop]\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the index of the first occurrence of value in sequence .\n\nRaises ValueError if value is not found in sequence .\n\nThe start or stop arguments allow for efficient searching\nof subsections of the sequence, beginning at start and ending at stop .\nThis is roughly equivalent to start + sequence[start:stop].index(value) ,\nonly without copying any data.\n\nCaution\n\nNot all sequence types support passing the start and stop arguments.\n\n### Immutable Sequence Types\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe only operation that immutable sequence types generally implement that is\nnot also implemented by mutable sequence types is support for the hash() built-in.\n\nThis support allows immutable sequences, such as tuple instances, to\nbe used as dict keys and stored in set and frozenset instances.\n\nAttempting to hash an immutable sequence that contains unhashable values will\nresult in TypeError .\n\n### Mutable Sequence Types\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe operations in the following table are defined on mutable sequence types.\nThe collections.abc.MutableSequence ABC is provided to make it\neasier to correctly implement these operations on custom sequence types.\n\nIn the table s is an instance of a mutable sequence type, t is any\niterable object and x is an arbitrary object that meets any type\nand value restrictions imposed by s (for example, bytearray only\naccepts integers that meet the value restriction 0 <= x <= 255 ).\n\nNotes:\n\n- If k is not equal to 1 , t must have the same length as the slice it is replacing.\n- The value n is an integer, or an object implementing __index__() .  Zero and negative values of n clear\nthe sequence.  Items in the sequence are not copied; they are referenced\nmultiple times, as explained for s * n under Common Sequence Operations .\n\nMutable Sequence Methods\n\nMutable sequence types also support the following methods:\n\nsequence.\nappend\n(\nvalue\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nAppend value to the end of the sequence\nThis is equivalent to writing seq[len(seq):len(seq)] = [value] .\n\nsequence.\nclear\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nAdded in version 3.3.\n\nRemove all items from sequence .\nThis is equivalent to writing del sequence[:] .\n\nsequence.\ncopy\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nAdded in version 3.3.\n\nCreate a shallow copy of sequence .\nThis is equivalent to writing sequence[:] .\n\nHint\n\nThe copy() method is not part of the MutableSequence ABC ,\nbut most concrete mutable sequence types provide it.\n\nsequence.\nextend\n(\niterable\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nExtend sequence with the contents of iterable .\nFor the most part, this is the same as writing seq[len(seq):len(seq)] = iterable .\n\nsequence.\ninsert\n(\nindex\n,\nvalue\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nInsert value into sequence at the given index .\nThis is equivalent to writing sequence[index:index] = [value] .\n\nsequence.\npop\n(\nindex\n=\n-1\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nRetrieve the item at index and also removes it from sequence .\nBy default, the last item in sequence is removed and returned.\n\nsequence.\nremove\n(\nvalue\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nRemove the first item from sequence where sequence[i] == value .\n\nRaises ValueError if value is not found in sequence .\n\nsequence.\nreverse\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReverse the items of sequence in place.\nThis method maintains economy of space when reversing a large sequence.\nTo remind users that it operates by side-effect, it returns None .\n\n### Lists\u00c2\u00b6\n\nLists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of\nhomogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by\napplication).\n\nclass\nlist\n(\niterable\n=\n()\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nLists may be constructed in several ways:\n\n- Using a pair of square brackets to denote the empty list: []\n- Using square brackets, separating items with commas: [a] , [a, b, c]\n- Using a list comprehension: [x for x in iterable]\n- Using the type constructor: list() or list(iterable)\n\nThe constructor builds a list whose items are the same and in the same\norder as iterable \u00e2\u0080\u0099s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a\ncontainer that supports iteration, or an iterator object.  If iterable is already a list, a copy is made and returned, similar to iterable[:] .\nFor example, list('abc') returns ['a', 'b', 'c'] and list( (1, 2, 3) ) returns [1, 2, 3] .\nIf no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list, [] .\n\nMany other operations also produce lists, including the sorted() built-in.\n\nLists implement all of the common and mutable sequence operations. Lists also provide the\nfollowing additional method:\n\nsort\n(\n*\n,\nkey\n=\nNone\n,\nreverse\n=\nFalse\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nThis method sorts the list in place, using only < comparisons\nbetween items. Exceptions are not suppressed - if any comparison operations\nfail, the entire sort operation will fail (and the list will likely be left\nin a partially modified state).\n\nsort() accepts two arguments that can only be passed by keyword\n( keyword-only arguments ):\n\nkey specifies a function of one argument that is used to extract a\ncomparison key from each list element (for example, key=str.lower ).\nThe key corresponding to each item in the list is calculated once and\nthen used for the entire sorting process. The default value of None means that list items are sorted directly without calculating a separate\nkey value.\n\nThe functools.cmp_to_key() utility is available to convert a 2.x\nstyle cmp function to a key function.\n\nreverse is a boolean value.  If set to True , then the list elements\nare sorted as if each comparison were reversed.\n\nThis method modifies the sequence in place for economy of space when\nsorting a large sequence.  To remind users that it operates by side\neffect, it does not return the sorted sequence (use sorted() to\nexplicitly request a new sorted list instance).\n\nThe sort() method is guaranteed to be stable.  A sort is stable if it\nguarantees not to change the relative order of elements that compare equal\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094 this is helpful for sorting in multiple passes (for example, sort by\ndepartment, then by salary grade).\n\nFor sorting examples and a brief sorting tutorial, see Sorting Techniques .\n\nCPython implementation detail: While a list is being sorted, the effect of attempting to mutate, or even\ninspect, the list is undefined.  The C implementation of Python makes the\nlist appear empty for the duration, and raises ValueError if it can\ndetect that the list has been mutated during a sort.\n\nThread safety for list objects\n\nReading a single element from a list is atomic :\n\n```python\nlst[i]   # list.__getitem__\n```python\n\nThe following methods traverse the list and use atomic reads of each item to perform their function. That means that they may\nreturn results affected by concurrent modifications:\n\n```python\nitem in lst\nlst.index(item)\nlst.count(item)\n```python\n\nAll of the above operations avoid acquiring per-object locks . They do not block concurrent modifications. Other\noperations that hold a lock will not block these from observing intermediate\nstates.\n\nAll other operations from here on block using the per-object lock .\n\nWriting a single item via lst[i] = x is safe to call from multiple\nthreads and will not corrupt the list.\n\nThe following operations return new objects and appear atomic to other threads:\n\n```python\nlst1 + lst2    # concatenates two lists into a new list\nx * lst        # repeats lst x times into a new list\nlst.copy()     # returns a shallow copy of the list\n```python\n\nThe following methods that only operate on a single element with no shifting\nrequired are atomic :\n\n```python\nlst.append(x)  # append to the end of the list, no shifting required\nlst.pop()      # pop element from the end of the list, no shifting required\n```python\n\nThe clear() method is also atomic .\nOther threads cannot observe elements being removed.\n\nThe sort() method is not atomic .\nOther threads cannot observe intermediate states during sorting, but the\nlist appears empty for the duration of the sort.\n\nThe following operations may allow lock-free operations to observe\nintermediate states since they modify multiple elements in place:\n\n```python\nlst.insert(idx, item)  # shifts elements\nlst.pop(idx)           # idx not at the end of the list, shifts elements\nlst *= x               # copies elements in place\n```python\n\nThe remove() method may allow concurrent modifications since\nelement comparison may execute arbitrary Python code (via __eq__() ).\n\nextend() is safe to call from multiple threads.  However, its\nguarantees depend on the iterable passed to it. If it is a list , a tuple , a set , a frozenset , a dict or a dictionary view object (but not their subclasses), the extend operation is safe from concurrent modifications to the iterable.\nOtherwise, an iterator is created which can be concurrently modified by\nanother thread.  The same applies to inplace concatenation of a list with\nother iterables when using lst += iterable .\n\nSimilarly, assigning to a list slice with lst[i:j] = iterable is safe\nto call from multiple threads, but iterable is only locked when it is\nalso a list (but not its subclasses).\n\nOperations that involve multiple accesses, as well as iteration, are never\natomic. For example:\n\n```python\n# NOT atomic: read-modify-write\nlst[i] = lst[i] + 1\n\n# NOT atomic: check-then-act\nif lst:\n      item = lst.pop()\n\n# NOT thread-safe: iteration while modifying\nfor item in lst:\n      process(item)  # another thread may modify lst\n```python\n\nConsider external synchronization when sharing list instances\nacross threads.  See Python support for free threading for more information.\n\n### Tuples\u00c2\u00b6\n\nTuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of\nheterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the enumerate() built-in). Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of\nhomogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a set or dict instance).\n\nclass\ntuple\n(\niterable\n=\n()\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nTuples may be constructed in a number of ways:\n\n- Using a pair of parentheses to denote the empty tuple: ()\n- Using a trailing comma for a singleton tuple: a, or (a,)\n- Separating items with commas: a, b, c or (a, b, c)\n- Using the tuple() built-in: tuple() or tuple(iterable)\n\nThe constructor builds a tuple whose items are the same and in the same\norder as iterable \u00e2\u0080\u0099s items. iterable may be either a sequence, a\ncontainer that supports iteration, or an iterator object.  If iterable is already a tuple, it is returned unchanged. For example, tuple('abc') returns ('a', 'b', 'c') and tuple( [1, 2, 3] ) returns (1, 2, 3) .\nIf no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty tuple, () .\n\nNote that it is actually the comma which makes a tuple, not the parentheses.\nThe parentheses are optional, except in the empty tuple case, or\nwhen they are needed to avoid syntactic ambiguity. For example, f(a, b, c) is a function call with three arguments, while f((a, b, c)) is a function call with a 3-tuple as the sole argument.\n\nTuples implement all of the common sequence\noperations.\n\nFor heterogeneous collections of data where access by name is clearer than\naccess by index, collections.namedtuple() may be a more appropriate\nchoice than a simple tuple object.\n\n### Ranges\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe range type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is\ncommonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops.\n\nclass\nrange\n(\nstop\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nclass\nrange\n(\nstart\n,\nstop\n,\nstep\n=\n1\n,\n/\n)\nThe arguments to the range constructor must be integers (either built-in int or any object that implements the __index__() special\nmethod).  If the step argument is omitted, it defaults to 1 .\nIf the start argument is omitted, it defaults to 0 .\nIf step is zero, ValueError is raised.\n\nFor a positive step , the contents of a range r are determined by the\nformula r[i] = start + step*i where i >= 0 and r[i] < stop .\n\nFor a negative step , the contents of the range are still determined by\nthe formula r[i] = start + step*i , but the constraints are i >= 0 and r[i] > stop .\n\nA range object will be empty if r[0] does not meet the value\nconstraint. Ranges do support negative indices, but these are interpreted\nas indexing from the end of the sequence determined by the positive\nindices.\n\nRanges containing absolute values larger than sys.maxsize are\npermitted but some features (such as len() ) may raise OverflowError .\n\nRange examples:\n\n```python\n>>> list(range(10))\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n>>> list(range(1, 11))\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n>>> list(range(0, 30, 5))\n[0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]\n>>> list(range(0, 10, 3))\n[0, 3, 6, 9]\n>>> list(range(0, -10, -1))\n[0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9]\n>>> list(range(0))\n[]\n>>> list(range(1, 0))\n[]\n```python\n\nRanges implement all of the common sequence operations\nexcept concatenation and repetition (due to the fact that range objects can\nonly represent sequences that follow a strict pattern and repetition and\nconcatenation will usually violate that pattern).\n\nstart\n\u00c2\u00b6\nThe value of the start parameter (or 0 if the parameter was\nnot supplied)\n\nstop\n\u00c2\u00b6\nThe value of the stop parameter\n\nstep\n\u00c2\u00b6\nThe value of the step parameter (or 1 if the parameter was\nnot supplied)\n\nThe advantage of the range type over a regular list or tuple is that a range object will always take the same\n(small) amount of memory, no matter the size of the range it represents (as it\nonly stores the start , stop and step values, calculating individual\nitems and subranges as needed).\n\nRange objects implement the collections.abc.Sequence ABC, and provide\nfeatures such as containment tests, element index lookup, slicing and\nsupport for negative indices (see Sequence Types \u00e2\u0080\u0094 list, tuple, range ):\n\n```python\n>>> r = range(0, 20, 2)\n>>> r\nrange(0, 20, 2)\n>>> 11 in r\nFalse\n>>> 10 in r\nTrue\n>>> r.index(10)\n5\n>>> r[5]\n10\n>>> r[:5]\nrange(0, 10, 2)\n>>> r[-1]\n18\n```python\n\nTesting range objects for equality with == and != compares\nthem as sequences.  That is, two range objects are considered equal if\nthey represent the same sequence of values.  (Note that two range\nobjects that compare equal might have different start , stop and step attributes, for example range(0) == range(2, 1, 3) or range(0, 3, 2) == range(0, 4, 2) .)\n\nChanged in version 3.2: Implement the Sequence ABC.\nSupport slicing and negative indices.\nTest int objects for membership in constant time instead of\niterating through all items.\n\nChanged in version 3.3: Define \u00e2\u0080\u0098==\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098!=\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to compare range objects based on the\nsequence of values they define (instead of comparing based on\nobject identity).\n\nAdded the start , stop and step attributes.\n\nSee also\n\n- The linspace recipe shows how to implement a lazy version of range suitable for floating-point\napplications.\n\n## Text and Binary Sequence Type Methods Summary\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe following table summarizes the text and binary sequence types methods by\ncategory.\n\n## Text Sequence Type \u00e2\u0080\u0094str\u00c2\u00b6\n\nTextual data in Python is handled with str objects, or strings .\nStrings are immutable sequences of Unicode code points.  String literals are\nwritten in a variety of ways:\n\n- Single quotes: 'allows embedded \"double\" quotes'\n- Double quotes: \"allows embedded 'single' quotes\"\n- Triple quoted: '''Three single quotes''' , \"\"\"Three double quotes\"\"\"\n\nTriple quoted strings may span multiple lines - all associated whitespace will\nbe included in the string literal.\n\nString literals that are part of a single expression and have only whitespace\nbetween them will be implicitly converted to a single string literal. That\nis, (\"spam \" \"eggs\") == \"spam eggs\" .\n\nSee String and Bytes literals for more about the various forms of string literal,\nincluding supported escape sequences , and the r (\u00e2\u0080\u009craw\u00e2\u0080\u009d) prefix that\ndisables most escape sequence processing.\n\nStrings may also be created from other objects using the str constructor.\n\nSince there is no separate \u00e2\u0080\u009ccharacter\u00e2\u0080\u009d type, indexing a string produces\nstrings of length 1. That is, for a non-empty string s , s[0] == s[0:1] .\n\nThere is also no mutable string type, but str.join() or io.StringIO can be used to efficiently construct strings from\nmultiple fragments.\n\nChanged in version 3.3: For backwards compatibility with the Python 2 series, the u prefix is\nonce again permitted on string literals. It has no effect on the meaning\nof string literals and cannot be combined with the r prefix.\n\nclass\nstr\n(\n*\n,\nencoding\n=\n'utf-8'\n,\nerrors\n=\n'strict'\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nclass\nstr\n(\nobject\n)\nclass\nstr\n(\nobject\n,\nencoding\n,\nerrors\n=\n'strict'\n)\nclass\nstr\n(\nobject\n,\n*\n,\nerrors\n)\nReturn a string version of object .  If object is not\nprovided, returns the empty string.  Otherwise, the behavior of str() depends on whether encoding or errors is given, as follows.\n\nIf neither encoding nor errors is given, str(object) returns type(object).__str__(object) ,\nwhich is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cinformal\u00e2\u0080\u009d or nicely\nprintable string representation of object .  For string objects, this is\nthe string itself.  If object does not have a __str__() method, then str() falls back to returning repr(object) .\n\nIf at least one of encoding or errors is given, object should be a bytes-like object (e.g. bytes or bytearray ).  In\nthis case, if object is a bytes (or bytearray ) object,\nthen str(bytes, encoding, errors) is equivalent to bytes.decode(encoding, errors) .  Otherwise, the bytes\nobject underlying the buffer object is obtained before calling bytes.decode() .  See Binary Sequence Types \u00e2\u0080\u0094 bytes, bytearray, memoryview and Buffer Protocol for information on buffer objects.\n\nPassing a bytes object to str() without the encoding or errors arguments falls under the first case of returning the informal\nstring representation (see also the -b command-line option to\nPython).  For example:\n\n```python\n>>> str(b'Zoot!')\n\"b'Zoot!'\"\n```python\n\nFor more information on the str class and its methods, see Text Sequence Type \u00e2\u0080\u0094 str and the String Methods section below.  To output\nformatted strings, see the f-strings and Format String Syntax sections.  In addition, see the Text Processing Services section.\n\n### String Methods\u00c2\u00b6\n\nStrings implement all of the common sequence\noperations, along with the additional methods described below.\n\nStrings also support two styles of string formatting, one providing a large\ndegree of flexibility and customization (see str.format() , Format String Syntax and Custom String Formatting ) and the other based on C printf style formatting that handles a narrower range of types and is\nslightly harder to use correctly, but is often faster for the cases it can\nhandle ( printf-style String Formatting ).\n\nThe Text Processing Services section of the standard library covers a number of\nother modules that provide various text related utilities (including regular\nexpression support in the re module).\n\nstr.\ncapitalize\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a copy of the string with its first character capitalized and the\nrest lowercased.\n\nChanged in version 3.8: The first character is now put into titlecase rather than uppercase.\nThis means that characters like digraphs will only have their first\nletter capitalized, instead of the full character.\n\nstr.\ncasefold\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a casefolded copy of the string. Casefolded strings may be used for\ncaseless matching.\n\nCasefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it is\nintended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For example, the German\nlowercase letter '\u00c3\u009f' is equivalent to \"ss\" . Since it is already\nlowercase, lower() would do nothing to '\u00c3\u009f' ; casefold() converts it to \"ss\" .\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'stra\u00c3\u009fe'.lower()\n'stra\u00c3\u009fe'\n>>> 'stra\u00c3\u009fe'.casefold()\n'strasse'\n```python\n\nThe casefolding algorithm is described in section 3.13 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Default Case Folding\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the Unicode Standard .\n\nAdded in version 3.3.\n\nstr.\ncenter\n(\nwidth\n,\nfillchar\n=\n'\n'\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn centered in a string of length width . Padding is done using the\nspecified fillchar (default is an ASCII space). The original string is\nreturned if width is less than or equal to len(s) .  For example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'Python'.center(10)\n'  Python  '\n>>> 'Python'.center(10, '-')\n'--Python--'\n>>> 'Python'.center(4)\n'Python'\n```python\n\nstr.\ncount\n(\nsub\n[\n,\nstart\n[\n,\nend\n]\n]\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in the\nrange [ start , end ].  Optional arguments start and end are\ninterpreted as in slice notation.\n\nIf sub is empty, returns the number of empty strings between characters\nwhich is the length of the string plus one. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.count('spam')\n3\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.count('spam', 5)\n2\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.count('spam', 5, 10)\n1\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.count('eggs')\n0\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.count('')\n17\n```python\n\nstr.\nencode\n(\nencoding\n=\n'utf-8'\n,\nerrors\n=\n'strict'\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the string encoded to bytes .\n\nencoding defaults to 'utf-8' ;\nsee Standard Encodings for possible values.\n\nerrors controls how encoding errors are handled.\nIf 'strict' (the default), a UnicodeError exception is raised.\nOther possible values are 'ignore' , 'replace' , 'xmlcharrefreplace' , 'backslashreplace' and any\nother name registered via codecs.register_error() .\nSee Error Handlers for details.\n\nFor performance reasons, the value of errors is not checked for validity\nunless an encoding error actually occurs, Python Development Mode is enabled\nor a debug build is used.\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> encoded_str_to_bytes = 'Python'.encode()\n>>> type(encoded_str_to_bytes)\n<class 'bytes'>\n>>> encoded_str_to_bytes\nb'Python'\n```python\n\nChanged in version 3.1: Added support for keyword arguments.\n\nChanged in version 3.9: The value of the errors argument is now checked in Python Development Mode and\nin debug mode .\n\nstr.\nendswith\n(\nsuffix\n[\n,\nstart\n[\n,\nend\n]\n]\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if the string ends with the specified suffix , otherwise return False . suffix can also be a tuple of suffixes to look for.  With optional start , test beginning at that position.  With optional end , stop comparing\nat that position. Using start and end is equivalent to str[start:end].endswith(suffix) . For example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'Python'.endswith('on')\nTrue\n>>> 'a tuple of suffixes'.endswith(('at', 'in'))\nFalse\n>>> 'a tuple of suffixes'.endswith(('at', 'es'))\nTrue\n>>> 'Python is amazing'.endswith('is', 0, 9)\nTrue\n```python\n\nSee also startswith() and removesuffix() .\n\nstr.\nexpandtabs\n(\ntabsize\n=\n8\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a copy of the string where all tab characters are replaced by one or\nmore spaces, depending on the current column and the given tab size.  Tab\npositions occur every tabsize characters (default is 8, giving tab\npositions at columns 0, 8, 16 and so on).  To expand the string, the current\ncolumn is set to zero and the string is examined character by character.  If\nthe character is a tab ( \\t ), one or more space characters are inserted\nin the result until the current column is equal to the next tab position.\n(The tab character itself is not copied.)  If the character is a newline\n( \\n ) or return ( \\r ), it is copied and the current column is reset to\nzero.  Any other character is copied unchanged and the current column is\nincremented by one regardless of how the character is represented when\nprinted. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> '01\\t012\\t0123\\t01234'.expandtabs()\n'01      012     0123    01234'\n>>> '01\\t012\\t0123\\t01234'.expandtabs(4)\n'01  012 0123    01234'\n>>> print('01\\t012\\n0123\\t01234'.expandtabs(4))\n01  012\n0123    01234\n```python\n\nstr.\nfind\n(\nsub\n[\n,\nstart\n[\n,\nend\n]\n]\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the lowest index in the string where substring sub is found within\nthe slice s[start:end] .  Optional arguments start and end are\ninterpreted as in slice notation.  Return -1 if sub is not found.\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.find('sp')\n0\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.find('sp', 5)\n6\n```python\n\nSee also rfind() and index() .\n\nNote\n\nThe find() method should be used only if you need to know the\nposition of sub .  To check if sub is a substring or not, use the in operator:\n\n```python\n>>> 'Py' in 'Python'\nTrue\n```python\n\nstr.\nformat\n(\n*\nargs\n,\n**\nkwargs\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nPerform a string formatting operation.  The string on which this method is\ncalled can contain literal text or replacement fields delimited by braces {} .  Each replacement field contains either the numeric index of a\npositional argument, or the name of a keyword argument.  Returns a copy of\nthe string where each replacement field is replaced with the string value of\nthe corresponding argument. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> \"The sum of 1 + 2 is {0}\".format(1+2)\n'The sum of 1 + 2 is 3'\n>>> \"The sum of {a} + {b} is {answer}\".format(answer=1+2, a=1, b=2)\n'The sum of 1 + 2 is 3'\n>>> \"{1} expects the {0} Inquisition!\".format(\"Spanish\", \"Nobody\")\n'Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!'\n```python\n\nSee Format String Syntax for a description of the various formatting options\nthat can be specified in format strings.\n\nNote\n\nWhen formatting a number ( int , float , complex , decimal.Decimal and subclasses) with the n type\n(ex: '{:n}'.format(1234) ), the function temporarily sets the LC_CTYPE locale to the LC_NUMERIC locale to decode decimal_point and thousands_sep fields of localeconv() if\nthey are non-ASCII or longer than 1 byte, and the LC_NUMERIC locale is\ndifferent than the LC_CTYPE locale.  This temporary change affects\nother threads.\n\nChanged in version 3.7: When formatting a number with the n type, the function sets\ntemporarily the LC_CTYPE locale to the LC_NUMERIC locale in some\ncases.\n\nstr.\nformat_map\n(\nmapping\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nSimilar to str.format(**mapping) , except that mapping is\nused directly and not copied to a dict .  This is useful\nif for example mapping is a dict subclass:\n\n```python\n>>> class Default(dict):\n...     def __missing__(self, key):\n...         return key\n...\n>>> '{name} was born in {country}'.format_map(Default(name='Guido'))\n'Guido was born in country'\n```python\n\nAdded in version 3.2.\n\nstr.\nindex\n(\nsub\n[\n,\nstart\n[\n,\nend\n]\n]\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nLike find() , but raise ValueError when the substring is\nnot found. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.index('spam')\n0\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.index('eggs')\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<python-input-0>\", line 1, in <module>\n    'spam, spam, spam'.index('eggs')\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^\nValueError: substring not found\n```python\n\nSee also rindex() .\n\nstr.\nisalnum\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if all characters in the string are alphanumeric and there is at\nleast one character, False otherwise.  A character c is alphanumeric if one\nof the following returns True : c.isalpha() , c.isdecimal() , c.isdigit() , or c.isnumeric() . For example:\n\n```python\n.. doctest::\n```python\n\n```python\n>>> 'abc123'.isalnum()\nTrue\n>>> 'abc123!@#'.isalnum()\nFalse\n>>> ''.isalnum()\nFalse\n>>> ' '.isalnum()\nFalse\n```python\n\nstr.\nisalpha\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least\none character, False otherwise.  Alphabetic characters are those characters defined\nin the Unicode character database as \u00e2\u0080\u009cLetter\u00e2\u0080\u009d, i.e., those with general category\nproperty being one of \u00e2\u0080\u009cLm\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLt\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLu\u00e2\u0080\u009d, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLl\u00e2\u0080\u009d, or \u00e2\u0080\u009cLo\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Note that this is different\nfrom the Alphabetic property defined in the section 4.10 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Letters, Alphabetic, and\nIdeographic\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the Unicode Standard .\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'Letters and spaces'.isalpha()\nFalse\n>>> 'LettersOnly'.isalpha()\nTrue\n>>> '\u00c2\u00b5'.isalpha()  # non-ASCII characters can be considered alphabetical too\nTrue\n```python\n\nSee Unicode Properties .\n\nstr.\nisascii\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if the string is empty or all characters in the string are ASCII, False otherwise.\nASCII characters have code points in the range U+0000-U+007F. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'ASCII characters'.isascii()\nTrue\n>>> '\u00c2\u00b5'.isascii()\nFalse\n```python\n\nAdded in version 3.7.\n\nstr.\nisdecimal\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if all characters in the string are decimal\ncharacters and there is at least one character, False otherwise. Decimal characters are those that can be used to form\nnumbers in base 10, such as U+0660, ARABIC-INDIC DIGIT\nZERO.  Formally a decimal character is a character in the Unicode\nGeneral Category \u00e2\u0080\u009cNd\u00e2\u0080\u009d. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> '0123456789'.isdecimal()\nTrue\n>>> '\u00d9\u00a0\u00d9\u00a1\u00d9\u00a2\u00d9\u00a3\u00d9\u00a4\u00d9\u00a5\u00d9\u00a6\u00d9\u00a7\u00d9\u00a8\u00d9\u00a9'.isdecimal()  # Arabic-Indic digits zero to nine\nTrue\n>>> 'alphabetic'.isdecimal()\nFalse\n```python\n\nstr.\nisdigit\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if all characters in the string are digits and there is at least one\ncharacter, False otherwise.  Digits include decimal characters and digits that need\nspecial handling, such as the compatibility superscript digits.\nThis covers digits which cannot be used to form numbers in base 10,\nlike the Kharosthi numbers.  Formally, a digit is a character that has the\nproperty value Numeric_Type=Digit or Numeric_Type=Decimal.\n\nstr.\nisidentifier\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if the string is a valid identifier according to the language\ndefinition, section Names (identifiers and keywords) .\n\nkeyword.iskeyword() can be used to test whether string s is a reserved\nidentifier, such as def and class .\n\nExample:\n\n```python\n>>> from keyword import iskeyword\n\n>>> 'hello'.isidentifier(), iskeyword('hello')\n(True, False)\n>>> 'def'.isidentifier(), iskeyword('def')\n(True, True)\n```python\n\nstr.\nislower\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if all cased characters [ 4 ] in the string are lowercase and\nthere is at least one cased character, False otherwise.\n\nstr.\nisnumeric\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if all characters in the string are numeric\ncharacters, and there is at least one character, False otherwise. Numeric characters include digit characters, and all characters\nthat have the Unicode numeric value property, e.g. U+2155,\nVULGAR FRACTION ONE FIFTH.  Formally, numeric characters are those with the property\nvalue Numeric_Type=Digit, Numeric_Type=Decimal or Numeric_Type=Numeric.\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> '0123456789'.isnumeric()\nTrue\n>>> '\u00d9\u00a0\u00d9\u00a1\u00d9\u00a2\u00d9\u00a3\u00d9\u00a4\u00d9\u00a5\u00d9\u00a6\u00d9\u00a7\u00d9\u00a8\u00d9\u00a9'.isnumeric()  # Arabic-indic digit zero to nine\nTrue\n>>> '\u00e2\n\u0095'.isnumeric()  # Vulgar fraction one fifth\nTrue\n>>> '\u00c2\u00b2'.isdecimal(), '\u00c2\u00b2'.isdigit(),  '\u00c2\u00b2'.isnumeric()\n(False, True, True)\n```python\n\nSee also isdecimal() and isdigit() . Numeric characters are\na superset of decimal numbers.\n\nstr.\nisprintable\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if all characters in the string are printable, False if it\ncontains at least one non-printable character.\n\nHere \u00e2\u0080\u009cprintable\u00e2\u0080\u009d means the character is suitable for repr() to use in\nits output; \u00e2\u0080\u009cnon-printable\u00e2\u0080\u009d means that repr() on built-in types will\nhex-escape the character.  It has no bearing on the handling of strings\nwritten to sys.stdout or sys.stderr .\n\nThe printable characters are those which in the Unicode character database\n(see unicodedata ) have a general category in group Letter, Mark,\nNumber, Punctuation, or Symbol (L, M, N, P, or S); plus the ASCII space 0x20.\nNonprintable characters are those in group Separator or Other (Z or C),\nexcept the ASCII space.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> ''.isprintable(), ' '.isprintable()\n(True, True)\n>>> '\\t'.isprintable(), '\\n'.isprintable()\n(False, False)\n```python\n\nstr.\nisspace\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if there are only whitespace characters in the string and there is\nat least one character, False otherwise.\n\nA character is whitespace if in the Unicode character database\n(see unicodedata ), either its general category is Zs (\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeparator, space\u00e2\u0080\u009d), or its bidirectional class is one of WS , B , or S .\n\nstr.\nistitle\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if the string is a titlecased string and there is at least one\ncharacter, for example uppercase characters may only follow uncased characters\nand lowercase characters only cased ones.  Return False otherwise.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'Spam, Spam, Spam'.istitle()\nTrue\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.istitle()\nFalse\n>>> 'SPAM, SPAM, SPAM'.istitle()\nFalse\n```python\n\nSee also title() .\n\nstr.\nisupper\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if all cased characters [ 4 ] in the string are uppercase and\nthere is at least one cased character, False otherwise.\n\n```python\n>>> 'BANANA'.isupper()\nTrue\n>>> 'banana'.isupper()\nFalse\n>>> 'baNana'.isupper()\nFalse\n>>> ' '.isupper()\nFalse\n```python\n\nstr.\njoin\n(\niterable\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable .\nA TypeError will be raised if there are any non-string values in iterable , including bytes objects.  The separator between\nelements is the string providing this method. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> ', '.join(['spam', 'spam', 'spam'])\n'spam, spam, spam'\n>>> '-'.join('Python')\n'P-y-t-h-o-n'\n```python\n\nSee also split() .\n\nstr.\nljust\n(\nwidth\n,\nfillchar\n=\n'\n'\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the string left justified in a string of length width . Padding is\ndone using the specified fillchar (default is an ASCII space). The\noriginal string is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s) .\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'Python'.ljust(10)\n'Python    '\n>>> 'Python'.ljust(10, '.')\n'Python....'\n>>> 'Monty Python'.ljust(10, '.')\n'Monty Python'\n```python\n\nSee also rjust() .\n\nstr.\nlower\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a copy of the string with all the cased characters [ 4 ] converted to\nlowercase. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'Lower Method Example'.lower()\n'lower method example'\n```python\n\nThe lowercasing algorithm used is described in section 3.13 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Default Case Folding\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the Unicode Standard .\n\nstr.\nlstrip\n(\nchars\n=\nNone\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a copy of the string with leading characters removed.  The chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed.  If omitted\nor None , the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace.  The chars argument is not a prefix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped:\n\n```python\n>>> '   spacious   '.lstrip()\n'spacious   '\n>>> 'www.example.com'.lstrip('cmowz.')\n'example.com'\n```python\n\nSee str.removeprefix() for a method that will remove a single prefix\nstring rather than all of a set of characters.  For example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'Arthur: three!'.lstrip('Arthur: ')\n'ee!'\n>>> 'Arthur: three!'.removeprefix('Arthur: ')\n'three!'\n```python\n\nstatic\nstr.\nmaketrans\n(\ndict\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nstatic\nstr.\nmaketrans\n(\nfrom\n,\nto\n,\nremove=''\n,\n/\n)\nThis static method returns a translation table usable for str.translate() .\n\nIf there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping Unicode\nordinals (integers) or characters (strings of length 1) to Unicode ordinals,\nstrings (of arbitrary lengths) or None .  Character keys will then be\nconverted to ordinals.\n\nIf there are two arguments, they must be strings of equal length, and in the\nresulting dictionary, each character in from will be mapped to the character at\nthe same position in to .  If there is a third argument, it must be a string,\nwhose characters will be mapped to None in the result.\n\nstr.\npartition\n(\nsep\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nSplit the string at the first occurrence of sep , and return a 3-tuple\ncontaining the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part\nafter the separator.  If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple containing\nthe string itself, followed by two empty strings.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'Monty Python'.partition(' ')\n('Monty', ' ', 'Python')\n>>> \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\".partition(' ')\n('Monty', ' ', \"Python's Flying Circus\")\n>>> 'Monty Python'.partition('-')\n('Monty Python', '', '')\n```python\n\nSee also rpartition() .\n\nstr.\nremoveprefix\n(\nprefix\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nIf the string starts with the prefix string, return string[len(prefix):] . Otherwise, return a copy of the original\nstring:\n\n```python\n>>> 'TestHook'.removeprefix('Test')\n'Hook'\n>>> 'BaseTestCase'.removeprefix('Test')\n'BaseTestCase'\n```python\n\nAdded in version 3.9.\n\nSee also removesuffix() and startswith() .\n\nstr.\nremovesuffix\n(\nsuffix\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nIf the string ends with the suffix string and that suffix is not empty,\nreturn string[:-len(suffix)] . Otherwise, return a copy of the\noriginal string:\n\n```python\n>>> 'MiscTests'.removesuffix('Tests')\n'Misc'\n>>> 'TmpDirMixin'.removesuffix('Tests')\n'TmpDirMixin'\n```python\n\nAdded in version 3.9.\n\nSee also removeprefix() and endswith() .\n\nstr.\nreplace\n(\nold\n,\nnew\n,\n/\n,\ncount\n=\n-1\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring old replaced by new .  If count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced.\nIf count is not specified or -1 , then all occurrences are replaced.\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.replace('spam', 'eggs')\n'eggs, eggs, eggs'\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.replace('spam', 'eggs', 1)\n'eggs, spam, spam'\n```python\n\nChanged in version 3.13: count is now supported as a keyword argument.\n\nstr.\nrfind\n(\nsub\n[\n,\nstart\n[\n,\nend\n]\n]\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the highest index in the string where substring sub is found, such\nthat sub is contained within s[start:end] .  Optional arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.  Return -1 on failure.\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.rfind('sp')\n12\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.rfind('sp', 0, 10)\n6\n```python\n\nSee also find() and rindex() .\n\nstr.\nrindex\n(\nsub\n[\n,\nstart\n[\n,\nend\n]\n]\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nLike rfind() but raises ValueError when the substring sub is not\nfound.\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.rindex('spam')\n12\n>>> 'spam, spam, spam'.rindex('eggs')\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin-0>\", line 1, in <module>\n    'spam, spam, spam'.rindex('eggs')\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^^^^^^^\nValueError: substring not found\n```python\n\nSee also index() and find() .\n\nstr.\nrjust\n(\nwidth\n,\nfillchar\n=\n'\n'\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the string right justified in a string of length width . Padding is\ndone using the specified fillchar (default is an ASCII space). The\noriginal string is returned if width is less than or equal to len(s) .\n\nstr.\nrpartition\n(\nsep\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nSplit the string at the last occurrence of sep , and return a 3-tuple\ncontaining the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part\nafter the separator.  If the separator is not found, return a 3-tuple containing\ntwo empty strings, followed by the string itself.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'Monty Python'.rpartition(' ')\n('Monty', ' ', 'Python')\n>>> \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\".rpartition(' ')\n(\"Monty Python's Flying\", ' ', 'Circus')\n>>> 'Monty Python'.rpartition('-')\n('', '', 'Monty Python')\n```python\n\nSee also partition() .\n\nstr.\nrsplit\n(\nsep\n=\nNone\n,\nmaxsplit\n=\n-1\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter string.\nIf maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are done, the rightmost ones.  If sep is not specified or None , any whitespace string is a\nseparator.  Except for splitting from the right, rsplit() behaves like split() which is described in detail below.\n\nstr.\nrstrip\n(\nchars\n=\nNone\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a copy of the string with trailing characters removed.  The chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed.  If omitted\nor None , the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace.  The chars argument is not a suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped.\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> '   spacious   '.rstrip()\n'   spacious'\n>>> 'mississippi'.rstrip('ipz')\n'mississ'\n```python\n\nSee removesuffix() for a method that will remove a single suffix\nstring rather than all of a set of characters.  For example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'Monty Python'.rstrip(' Python')\n'M'\n>>> 'Monty Python'.removesuffix(' Python')\n'Monty'\n```python\n\nSee also strip() .\n\nstr.\nsplit\n(\nsep\n=\nNone\n,\nmaxsplit\n=\n-1\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a list of the words in the string, using sep as the delimiter\nstring.  If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are done (thus,\nthe list will have at most maxsplit+1 elements).  If maxsplit is not\nspecified or -1 , then there is no limit on the number of splits\n(all possible splits are made).\n\nIf sep is given, consecutive delimiters are not grouped together and are\ndeemed to delimit empty strings (for example, '1,,2'.split(',') returns ['1', '', '2'] ).  The sep argument may consist of multiple characters\nas a single delimiter (to split with multiple delimiters, use re.split() ). Splitting an empty string with a specified separator\nreturns [''] .\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> '1,2,3'.split(',')\n['1', '2', '3']\n>>> '1,2,3'.split(',', maxsplit=1)\n['1', '2,3']\n>>> '1,2,,3,'.split(',')\n['1', '2', '', '3', '']\n>>> '1<>2<>3<4'.split('<>')\n['1', '2', '3<4']\n```python\n\nIf sep is not specified or is None , a different splitting algorithm is\napplied: runs of consecutive whitespace are regarded as a single separator,\nand the result will contain no empty strings at the start or end if the\nstring has leading or trailing whitespace.  Consequently, splitting an empty\nstring or a string consisting of just whitespace with a None separator\nreturns [] .\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> '1 2 3'.split()\n['1', '2', '3']\n>>> '1 2 3'.split(maxsplit=1)\n['1', '2 3']\n>>> '   1   2   3   '.split()\n['1', '2', '3']\n```python\n\nIf sep is not specified or is None and maxsplit is 0 , only\nleading runs of consecutive whitespace are considered.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> \"\".split(None, 0)\n[]\n>>> \"   \".split(None, 0)\n[]\n>>> \"   foo   \".split(maxsplit=0)\n['foo   ']\n```python\n\nSee also join() .\n\nstr.\nsplitlines\n(\nkeepends\n=\nFalse\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a list of the lines in the string, breaking at line boundaries.  Line\nbreaks are not included in the resulting list unless keepends is given and\ntrue.\n\nThis method splits on the following line boundaries.  In particular, the\nboundaries are a superset of universal newlines .\n\nChanged in version 3.2: \\v and \\f added to list of line boundaries.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'ab c\\n\\nde fg\\rkl\\r\\n'.splitlines()\n['ab c', '', 'de fg', 'kl']\n>>> 'ab c\\n\\nde fg\\rkl\\r\\n'.splitlines(keepends=True)\n['ab c\\n', '\\n', 'de fg\\r', 'kl\\r\\n']\n```python\n\nUnlike split() when a delimiter string sep is given, this\nmethod returns an empty list for the empty string, and a terminal line\nbreak does not result in an extra line:\n\n```python\n>>> \"\".splitlines()\n[]\n>>> \"One line\\n\".splitlines()\n['One line']\n```python\n\nFor comparison, split('\\n') gives:\n\n```python\n>>> ''.split('\\n')\n['']\n>>> 'Two lines\\n'.split('\\n')\n['Two lines', '']\n```python\n\nstr.\nstartswith\n(\nprefix\n[\n,\nstart\n[\n,\nend\n]\n]\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if string starts with the prefix , otherwise return False . prefix can also be a tuple of prefixes to look for.  With optional start ,\ntest string beginning at that position.  With optional end , stop comparing\nstring at that position.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'Python'.startswith('Py')\nTrue\n>>> 'a tuple of prefixes'.startswith(('at', 'a'))\nTrue\n>>> 'Python is amazing'.startswith('is', 7)\nTrue\n```python\n\nSee also endswith() and removeprefix() .\n\nstr.\nstrip\n(\nchars\n=\nNone\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed.\nThe chars argument is a string specifying the set of characters to be removed.\nIf omitted or None , the chars argument defaults to removing whitespace.\nThe chars argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its\nvalues are stripped.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> '   spacious   '.strip()\n'spacious'\n>>> 'www.example.com'.strip('cmowz.')\n'example'\n```python\n\nThe outermost leading and trailing chars argument values are stripped\nfrom the string. Characters are removed from the leading end until\nreaching a string character that is not contained in the set of\ncharacters in chars . A similar action takes place on the trailing end.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> comment_string = '#....... Section 3.2.1 Issue #32 .......'\n>>> comment_string.strip('.#! ')\n'Section 3.2.1 Issue #32'\n```python\n\nSee also rstrip() .\n\nstr.\nswapcase\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a copy of the string with uppercase characters converted to lowercase and\nvice versa. Note that it is not necessarily true that s.swapcase().swapcase() == s .\n\nstr.\ntitle\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a titlecased version of the string where words start with an uppercase\ncharacter and the remaining characters are lowercase.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> 'Hello world'.title()\n'Hello World'\n```python\n\nThe algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a word as\ngroups of consecutive letters.  The definition works in many contexts but\nit means that apostrophes in contractions and possessives form word\nboundaries, which may not be the desired result:\n\n```python\n>>> \"they're bill's friends from the UK\".title()\n\"They'Re Bill'S Friends From The Uk\"\n```python\n\nThe string.capwords() function does not have this problem, as it\nsplits words on spaces only.\n\nAlternatively, a workaround for apostrophes can be constructed using regular\nexpressions:\n\n```python\n>>> import re\n>>> def titlecase(s):\n...     return re.sub(r\"[A-Za-z]+('[A-Za-z]+)?\",\n...                   lambda mo: mo.group(0).capitalize(),\n...                   s)\n...\n>>> titlecase(\"they're bill's friends.\")\n\"They're Bill's Friends.\"\n```python\n\nSee also istitle() .\n\nstr.\ntranslate\n(\ntable\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a copy of the string in which each character has been mapped through\nthe given translation table.  The table must be an object that implements\nindexing via __getitem__() , typically a mapping or sequence .  When indexed by a Unicode ordinal (an integer), the\ntable object can do any of the following: return a Unicode ordinal or a\nstring, to map the character to one or more other characters; return None , to delete the character from the return string; or raise a LookupError exception, to map the character to itself.\n\nYou can use str.maketrans() to create a translation map from\ncharacter-to-character mappings in different formats.\n\nSee also the codecs module for a more flexible approach to custom\ncharacter mappings.\n\nstr.\nupper\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a copy of the string with all the cased characters [ 4 ] converted to\nuppercase.  Note that s.upper().isupper() might be False if s contains uncased characters or if the Unicode category of the resulting\ncharacter(s) is not \u00e2\u0080\u009cLu\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Letter, uppercase), but e.g. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLt\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Letter,\ntitlecase).\n\nThe uppercasing algorithm used is described in section 3.13 \u00e2\u0080\u0098Default Case Folding\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the Unicode Standard .\n\nstr.\nzfill\n(\nwidth\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a copy of the string left filled with ASCII '0' digits to\nmake a string of length width . A leading sign prefix ( '+' / '-' )\nis handled by inserting the padding after the sign character rather\nthan before. The original string is returned if width is less than\nor equal to len(s) .\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> \"42\".zfill(5)\n'00042'\n>>> \"-42\".zfill(5)\n'-0042'\n```python\n\n### Formatted String Literals (f-strings)\u00c2\u00b6\n\nAdded in version 3.6.\n\nChanged in version 3.7: The await and async for can be used in expressions\nwithin f-strings.\n\nChanged in version 3.8: Added the debug specifier ( = )\n\nChanged in version 3.12: Many restrictions on expressions within f-strings have been removed.\nNotably, nested strings, comments, and backslashes are now permitted.\n\nAn f-string (formally a formatted string literal ) is\na string literal that is prefixed with f or F .\nThis type of string literal allows embedding the results of arbitrary Python\nexpressions within replacement fields , which are delimited by curly\nbrackets ( {} ).\nEach replacement field must contain an expression, optionally followed by:\n\n- a debug specifier \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an equal sign ( = );\n- a conversion specifier \u00e2\u0080\u0093 !s , !r or !a ; and/or\n- a format specifier prefixed with a colon ( : ).\n\nSee the Lexical Analysis section on f-strings for details\non the syntax of these fields.\n\n#### Debug specifier\u00c2\u00b6\n\nAdded in version 3.8.\n\nIf a debug specifier \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an equal sign ( = ) \u00e2\u0080\u0093 appears after the replacement\nfield expression, the resulting f-string will contain the expression\u00e2\u0080\u0099s source,\nthe equal sign, and the value of the expression.\nThis is often useful for debugging:\n\n```python\n>>> number = 14.3\n>>> f'{number=}'\n'number=14.3'\n```python\n\nWhitespace before, inside and after the expression, as well as whitespace\nafter the equal sign, is significant \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it is retained in the result:\n\n```python\n>>> f'{ number  -  4  = }'\n' number  -  4  = 10.3'\n```python\n\n#### Conversion specifier\u00c2\u00b6\n\nBy default, the value of a replacement field expression is converted to\na string using str() :\n\n```python\n>>> from fractions import Fraction\n>>> one_third = Fraction(1, 3)\n>>> f'{one_third}'\n'1/3'\n```python\n\nWhen a debug specifier but no format specifier is used, the default conversion\ninstead uses repr() :\n\n```python\n>>> f'{one_third = }'\n'one_third = Fraction(1, 3)'\n```python\n\nThe conversion can be specified explicitly using one of these specifiers:\n\n- !s for str()\n- !r for repr()\n- !a for ascii()\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> str(one_third)\n'1/3'\n>>> repr(one_third)\n'Fraction(1, 3)'\n\n>>> f'{one_third!s} is {one_third!r}'\n'1/3 is Fraction(1, 3)'\n\n>>> string = \"\u00c2\u00a1ko\u00c4\u008dka \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u00b8!\"\n>>> ascii(string)\n\"'\\\\xa1ko\\\\u010dka \\\\U0001f638!'\"\n\n>>> f'{string = !a}'\n\"string = '\\\\xa1ko\\\\u010dka \\\\U0001f638!'\"\n```python\n\n#### Format specifier\u00c2\u00b6\n\nAfter the expression has been evaluated, and possibly converted using an\nexplicit conversion specifier, it is formatted using the format() function.\nIf the replacement field includes a format specifier introduced by a colon\n( : ), the specifier is passed to format() as the second argument.\nThe result of format() is then used as the final value for the\nreplacement field. For example:\n\n```python\n>>> from fractions import Fraction\n>>> one_third = Fraction(1, 3)\n>>> f'{one_third:.6f}'\n'0.333333'\n>>> f'{one_third:_^+10}'\n'___+1/3___'\n>>> >>> f'{one_third!r:_^20}'\n'___Fraction(1, 3)___'\n>>> f'{one_third = :~>10}~'\n'one_third = ~~~~~~~1/3~'\n```python\n\n### Template String Literals (t-strings)\u00c2\u00b6\n\nAn t-string (formally a template string literal ) is\na string literal that is prefixed with t or T .\n\nThese strings follow the same syntax and evaluation rules as formatted string literals ,\nwith for the following differences:\n\n- Rather than evaluating to a str object, template string literals evaluate\nto a string.templatelib.Template object.\n- The format() protocol is not used.\nInstead, the format specifier and conversions (if any) are passed to\na new Interpolation object that is created\nfor each evaluated expression.\nIt is up to code that processes the resulting Template object to decide how to handle format specifiers and conversions.\n- Format specifiers containing nested replacement fields are evaluated eagerly,\nprior to being passed to the Interpolation object.\nFor instance, an interpolation of the form {amount:.{precision}f} will\nevaluate the inner expression {precision} to determine the value of the format_spec attribute.\nIf precision were to be 2 , the resulting format specifier\nwould be '.2f' .\n- When the equals sign '=' is provided in an interpolation expression,\nthe text of the expression is appended to the literal string that precedes\nthe relevant interpolation.\nThis includes the equals sign and any surrounding whitespace.\nThe Interpolation instance for the expression will be created as\nnormal, except that conversion will\nbe set to \u00e2\u0080\u0098 r \u00e2\u0080\u0099 ( repr() ) by default.\nIf an explicit conversion or format specifier are provided,\nthis will override the default behaviour.\n\n### printf-style String Formatting\u00c2\u00b6\n\nNote\n\nThe formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that\nlead to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and\ndictionaries correctly).\n\nUsing formatted string literals , the str.format() interface, or string.Template may help avoid these errors.\nEach of these alternatives provides their own trade-offs and benefits of\nsimplicity, flexibility, and/or extensibility.\n\nString objects have one unique built-in operation: the % operator (modulo).\nThis is also known as the string formatting or interpolation operator.\nGiven format % values (where format is a string), % conversion\nspecifications in format are replaced with zero or more elements of values .\nThe effect is similar to using the sprintf() function in the C language.\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> print('%s has %d quote types.' % ('Python', 2))\nPython has 2 quote types.\n```python\n\nIf format requires a single argument, values may be a single non-tuple\nobject. [ 5 ] Otherwise, values must be a tuple with exactly the number of\nitems specified by the format string, or a single mapping object (for example, a\ndictionary).\n\nA conversion specifier contains two or more characters and has the following\ncomponents, which must occur in this order:\n\n- The '%' character, which marks the start of the specifier.\n- Mapping key (optional), consisting of a parenthesised sequence of characters\n(for example, (somename) ).\n- Conversion flags (optional), which affect the result of some conversion\ntypes.\n- Minimum field width (optional).  If specified as an '*' (asterisk), the\nactual width is read from the next element of the tuple in values , and the\nobject to convert comes after the minimum field width and optional precision.\n- Precision (optional), given as a '.' (dot) followed by the precision.  If\nspecified as '*' (an asterisk), the actual precision is read from the next\nelement of the tuple in values , and the value to convert comes after the\nprecision.\n- Length modifier (optional).\n- Conversion type.\n\nWhen the right argument is a dictionary (or other mapping type), then the\nformats in the string must include a parenthesised mapping key into that\ndictionary inserted immediately after the '%' character. The mapping key\nselects the value to be formatted from the mapping.  For example:\n\n```python\n>>> print('%(language)s has %(number)03d quote types.' %\n...       {'language': \"Python\", \"number\": 2})\nPython has 002 quote types.\n```python\n\nIn this case no * specifiers may occur in a format (since they require a\nsequential parameter list).\n\nThe conversion flag characters are:\n\nA length modifier ( h , l , or L ) may be present, but is ignored as it\nis not necessary for Python \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so e.g. %ld is identical to %d .\n\nThe conversion types are:\n\nNotes:\n\n- The alternate form causes a leading octal specifier ( '0o' ) to be\ninserted before the first digit.\n- The alternate form causes a leading '0x' or '0X' (depending on whether\nthe 'x' or 'X' format was used) to be inserted before the first digit.\n- The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, even if\nno digits follow it. The precision determines the number of digits after the decimal point and\ndefaults to 6.\n- The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, and\ntrailing zeroes are not removed as they would otherwise be. The precision determines the number of significant digits before and after the\ndecimal point and defaults to 6.\n- If precision is N , the output is truncated to N characters.\n- See PEP 237 .\n\nSince Python strings have an explicit length, %s conversions do not assume\nthat '\\0' is the end of the string.\n\nChanged in version 3.1: %f conversions for numbers whose absolute value is over 1e50 are no\nlonger replaced by %g conversions.\n\n## Binary Sequence Types \u00e2\u0080\u0094bytes,bytearray,memoryview\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe core built-in types for manipulating binary data are bytes and bytearray . They are supported by memoryview which uses\nthe buffer protocol to access the memory of other\nbinary objects without needing to make a copy.\n\nThe array module supports efficient storage of basic data types like\n32-bit integers and IEEE754 double-precision floating values.\n\n### Bytes Objects\u00c2\u00b6\n\nBytes objects are immutable sequences of single bytes. Since many major\nbinary protocols are based on the ASCII text encoding, bytes objects offer\nseveral methods that are only valid when working with ASCII compatible\ndata and are closely related to string objects in a variety of other ways.\n\nclass\nbytes\n(\nsource\n=\nb''\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nclass\nbytes\n(\nsource\n,\nencoding\n,\nerrors\n=\n'strict'\n)\nFirstly, the syntax for bytes literals is largely the same as that for string\nliterals, except that a b prefix is added:\n\n- Single quotes: b'still allows embedded \"double\" quotes'\n- Double quotes: b\"still allows embedded 'single' quotes\"\n- Triple quoted: b'''3 single quotes''' , b\"\"\"3 double quotes\"\"\"\n\nOnly ASCII characters are permitted in bytes literals (regardless of the\ndeclared source code encoding). Any binary values over 127 must be entered\ninto bytes literals using the appropriate escape sequence.\n\nAs with string literals, bytes literals may also use a r prefix to disable\nprocessing of escape sequences. See String and Bytes literals for more about the various\nforms of bytes literal, including supported escape sequences.\n\nWhile bytes literals and representations are based on ASCII text, bytes\nobjects actually behave like immutable sequences of integers, with each\nvalue in the sequence restricted such that 0 <= x < 256 (attempts to\nviolate this restriction will trigger ValueError ). This is done\ndeliberately to emphasise that while many binary formats include ASCII based\nelements and can be usefully manipulated with some text-oriented algorithms,\nthis is not generally the case for arbitrary binary data (blindly applying\ntext processing algorithms to binary data formats that are not ASCII\ncompatible will usually lead to data corruption).\n\nIn addition to the literal forms, bytes objects can be created in a number of\nother ways:\n\n- A zero-filled bytes object of a specified length: bytes(10)\n- From an iterable of integers: bytes(range(20))\n- Copying existing binary data via the buffer protocol: bytes(obj)\n\nAlso see the bytes built-in.\n\nSince 2 hexadecimal digits correspond precisely to a single byte, hexadecimal\nnumbers are a commonly used format for describing binary data. Accordingly,\nthe bytes type has an additional class method to read data in that format:\n\nclassmethod\nfromhex\n(\nstring\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nThis bytes class method returns a bytes object, decoding the\ngiven string object.  The string must contain two hexadecimal digits per\nbyte, with ASCII whitespace being ignored.\n\n```python\n>>> bytes.fromhex('2Ef0 F1f2  ')\nb'.\\xf0\\xf1\\xf2'\n```python\n\nChanged in version 3.7: bytes.fromhex() now skips all ASCII whitespace in the string,\nnot just spaces.\n\nChanged in version 3.14: bytes.fromhex() now accepts ASCII bytes and bytes-like objects as input.\n\nA reverse conversion function exists to transform a bytes object into its\nhexadecimal representation.\n\nhex\n(\n*\n,\nbytes_per_sep\n=\n1\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nhex\n(\nsep\n,\nbytes_per_sep\n=\n1\n)\nReturn a string object containing two hexadecimal digits for each\nbyte in the instance.\n\n```python\n>>> b'\\xf0\\xf1\\xf2'.hex()\n'f0f1f2'\n```python\n\nIf you want to make the hex string easier to read, you can specify a\nsingle character separator sep parameter to include in the output.\nBy default, this separator will be included between each byte.\nA second optional bytes_per_sep parameter controls the spacing.\nPositive values calculate the separator position from the right,\nnegative values from the left.\n\n```python\n>>> value = b'\\xf0\\xf1\\xf2'\n>>> value.hex('-')\n'f0-f1-f2'\n>>> value.hex('_', 2)\n'f0_f1f2'\n>>> b'UUDDLRLRAB'.hex(' ', -4)\n'55554444 4c524c52 4142'\n```python\n\nAdded in version 3.5.\n\nChanged in version 3.8: bytes.hex() now supports optional sep and bytes_per_sep parameters to insert separators between bytes in the hex output.\n\nSince bytes objects are sequences of integers (akin to a tuple), for a bytes\nobject b , b[0] will be an integer, while b[0:1] will be a bytes\nobject of length 1.  (This contrasts with text strings, where both indexing\nand slicing will produce a string of length 1)\n\nThe representation of bytes objects uses the literal format ( b'...' )\nsince it is often more useful than e.g. bytes([46, 46, 46]) .  You can\nalways convert a bytes object into a list of integers using list(b) .\n\n### Bytearray Objects\u00c2\u00b6\n\nbytearray objects are a mutable counterpart to bytes objects.\n\nclass\nbytearray\n(\nsource\n=\nb''\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nclass\nbytearray\n(\nsource\n,\nencoding\n,\nerrors\n=\n'strict'\n)\nThere is no dedicated literal syntax for bytearray objects, instead\nthey are always created by calling the constructor:\n\n- Creating an empty instance: bytearray()\n- Creating a zero-filled instance with a given length: bytearray(10)\n- From an iterable of integers: bytearray(range(20))\n- Copying existing binary data via the buffer protocol: bytearray(b'Hi!')\n\nAs bytearray objects are mutable, they support the mutable sequence operations in addition to the\ncommon bytes and bytearray operations described in Bytes and Bytearray Operations .\n\nAlso see the bytearray built-in.\n\nSince 2 hexadecimal digits correspond precisely to a single byte, hexadecimal\nnumbers are a commonly used format for describing binary data. Accordingly,\nthe bytearray type has an additional class method to read data in that format:\n\nclassmethod\nfromhex\n(\nstring\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nThis bytearray class method returns bytearray object, decoding\nthe given string object.  The string must contain two hexadecimal digits\nper byte, with ASCII whitespace being ignored.\n\n```python\n>>> bytearray.fromhex('2Ef0 F1f2  ')\nbytearray(b'.\\xf0\\xf1\\xf2')\n```python\n\nChanged in version 3.7: bytearray.fromhex() now skips all ASCII whitespace in the string,\nnot just spaces.\n\nChanged in version 3.14: bytearray.fromhex() now accepts ASCII bytes and bytes-like objects as input.\n\nA reverse conversion function exists to transform a bytearray object into its\nhexadecimal representation.\n\nhex\n(\n*\n,\nbytes_per_sep\n=\n1\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nhex\n(\nsep\n,\nbytes_per_sep\n=\n1\n)\nReturn a string object containing two hexadecimal digits for each\nbyte in the instance.\n\n```python\n>>> bytearray(b'\\xf0\\xf1\\xf2').hex()\n'f0f1f2'\n```python\n\nAdded in version 3.5.\n\nChanged in version 3.8: Similar to bytes.hex() , bytearray.hex() now supports\noptional sep and bytes_per_sep parameters to insert separators\nbetween bytes in the hex output.\n\nresize\n(\nsize\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nResize the bytearray to contain size bytes. size must be\ngreater than or equal to 0.\n\nIf the bytearray needs to shrink, bytes beyond size are truncated.\n\nIf the bytearray needs to grow, all new bytes, those beyond size ,\nwill be set to null bytes.\n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\n```python\n>>> def resize(ba, size):\n...     if len(ba) > size:\n...         del ba[size:]\n...     else:\n...         ba += b'\\0' * (size - len(ba))\n```python\n\nExamples:\n\n```python\n>>> shrink = bytearray(b'abc')\n>>> shrink.resize(1)\n>>> (shrink, len(shrink))\n(bytearray(b'a'), 1)\n>>> grow = bytearray(b'abc')\n>>> grow.resize(5)\n>>> (grow, len(grow))\n(bytearray(b'abc\\x00\\x00'), 5)\n```python\n\nAdded in version 3.14.\n\nSince bytearray objects are sequences of integers (akin to a list), for a\nbytearray object b , b[0] will be an integer, while b[0:1] will be\na bytearray object of length 1.  (This contrasts with text strings, where\nboth indexing and slicing will produce a string of length 1)\n\nThe representation of bytearray objects uses the bytes literal format\n( bytearray(b'...') ) since it is often more useful than e.g. bytearray([46, 46, 46]) .  You can always convert a bytearray object into\na list of integers using list(b) .\n\n### Bytes and Bytearray Operations\u00c2\u00b6\n\nBoth bytes and bytearray objects support the common sequence operations. They interoperate not just with operands of the same\ntype, but with any bytes-like object . Due to this flexibility, they can be\nfreely mixed in operations without causing errors. However, the return type\nof the result may depend on the order of operands.\n\nNote\n\nThe methods on bytes and bytearray objects don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept strings as their\narguments, just as the methods on strings don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept bytes as their\narguments.  For example, you have to write:\n\n```python\na = \"abc\"\nb = a.replace(\"a\", \"f\")\n```python\n\nand:\n\n```python\na = b\"abc\"\nb = a.replace(b\"a\", b\"f\")\n```python\n\nSome bytes and bytearray operations assume the use of ASCII compatible\nbinary formats, and hence should be avoided when working with arbitrary\nbinary data. These restrictions are covered below.\n\nNote\n\nUsing these ASCII based operations to manipulate binary data that is not\nstored in an ASCII based format may lead to data corruption.\n\nThe following methods on bytes and bytearray objects can be used with\narbitrary binary data.\n\nbytes.\ncount\n(\nsub\n[\n,\nstart\n[\n,\nend\n]\n]\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nbytearray.\ncount\n(\nsub\n[\n,\nstart\n[\n,\nend\n]\n]\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the number of non-overlapping occurrences of subsequence sub in\nthe range [ start , end ].

See removesuffix() for a method\nthat will remove a single suffix string rather than all of a set of\ncharacters.  For example:\n\n```python\n>>> b'Monty Python'.rstrip(b' Python')\nb'M'\n>>> b'Monty Python'.removesuffix(b' Python')\nb'Monty'\n```python\n\nNote\n\nThe bytearray version of this method does not operate in place -\nit always produces a new object, even if no changes were made.\n\nbytes.\nsplit\n(\nsep\n=\nNone\n,\nmaxsplit\n=\n-1\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nbytearray.\nsplit\n(\nsep\n=\nNone\n,\nmaxsplit\n=\n-1\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nSplit the binary sequence into subsequences of the same type, using sep as the delimiter string. If maxsplit is given and non-negative, at most maxsplit splits are done (thus, the list will have at most maxsplit+1 elements).  If maxsplit is not specified or is -1 , then there is no\nlimit on the number of splits (all possible splits are made).\n\nIf sep is given, consecutive delimiters are not grouped together and are\ndeemed to delimit empty subsequences (for example, b'1,,2'.split(b',') returns [b'1', b'', b'2'] ).  The sep argument may consist of a\nmultibyte sequence as a single delimiter. Splitting an empty sequence with\na specified separator returns [b''] or [bytearray(b'')] depending\non the type of object being split.  The sep argument may be any bytes-like object .\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> b'1,2,3'.split(b',')\n[b'1', b'2', b'3']\n>>> b'1,2,3'.split(b',', maxsplit=1)\n[b'1', b'2,3']\n>>> b'1,2,,3,'.split(b',')\n[b'1', b'2', b'', b'3', b'']\n>>> b'1<>2<>3<4'.split(b'<>')\n[b'1', b'2', b'3<4']\n```python\n\nIf sep is not specified or is None , a different splitting algorithm\nis applied: runs of consecutive ASCII whitespace are regarded as a single\nseparator, and the result will contain no empty strings at the start or\nend if the sequence has leading or trailing whitespace.  Consequently,\nsplitting an empty sequence or a sequence consisting solely of ASCII\nwhitespace without a specified separator returns [] .\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> b'1 2 3'.split()\n[b'1', b'2', b'3']\n>>> b'1 2 3'.split(maxsplit=1)\n[b'1', b'2 3']\n>>> b'   1   2   3   '.split()\n[b'1', b'2', b'3']\n```python\n\nbytes.\nstrip\n(\nbytes\n=\nNone\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nbytearray.\nstrip\n(\nbytes\n=\nNone\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a copy of the sequence with specified leading and trailing bytes\nremoved. The bytes argument is a binary sequence specifying the set of\nbyte values to be removed.  If omitted or None , the bytes argument defaults to removing ASCII whitespace.

Tab positions occur every tabsize bytes (default is 8,\ngiving tab positions at columns 0, 8, 16 and so on).  To expand the\nsequence, the current column is set to zero and the sequence is examined\nbyte by byte.  If the byte is an ASCII tab character ( b'\\t' ), one or\nmore space characters are inserted in the result until the current column\nis equal to the next tab position. (The tab character itself is not\ncopied.)  If the current byte is an ASCII newline ( b'\\n' ) or\ncarriage return ( b'\\r' ), it is copied and the current column is reset\nto zero.

Uppercase ASCII characters\nare those byte values in the sequence b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' .\nAll other byte values are uncased.\n\nThe algorithm uses a simple language-independent definition of a word as\ngroups of consecutive letters.  The definition works in many contexts but\nit means that apostrophes in contractions and possessives form word\nboundaries, which may not be the desired result:\n\n```python\n>>> b\"they're bill's friends from the UK\".title()\nb\"They'Re Bill'S Friends From The Uk\"\n```python\n\nA workaround for apostrophes can be constructed using regular expressions:\n\n```python\n>>> import re\n>>> def titlecase(s):\n...     return re.sub(rb\"[A-Za-z]+('[A-Za-z]+)?\",\n...                   lambda mo: mo.group(0)[0:1].upper() +\n...                              mo.group(0)[1:].lower(),\n...                   s)\n...\n>>> titlecase(b\"they're bill's friends.\")\nb\"They're Bill's Friends.\"\n```python\n\nNote\n\nThe bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it\nalways produces a new object, even if no changes were made.\n\nbytes.\nupper\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nbytearray.\nupper\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a copy of the sequence with all the lowercase ASCII characters\nconverted to their corresponding uppercase counterpart.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> b'Hello World'.upper()\nb'HELLO WORLD'\n```python\n\nLowercase ASCII characters are those byte values in the sequence b'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' . Uppercase ASCII characters\nare those byte values in the sequence b'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' .\n\nNote\n\nThe bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it\nalways produces a new object, even if no changes were made.\n\nbytes.\nzfill\n(\nwidth\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nbytearray.\nzfill\n(\nwidth\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a copy of the sequence left filled with ASCII b'0' digits to\nmake a sequence of length width . A leading sign prefix ( b'+' / b'-' ) is handled by inserting the padding after the sign character\nrather than before. For bytes objects, the original sequence is\nreturned if width is less than or equal to len(seq) .\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n>>> b\"42\".zfill(5)\nb'00042'\n>>> b\"-42\".zfill(5)\nb'-0042'\n```python\n\nNote\n\nThe bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it\nalways produces a new object, even if no changes were made.\n\n### printf-style Bytes Formatting\u00c2\u00b6\n\nNote\n\nThe formatting operations described here exhibit a variety of quirks that\nlead to a number of common errors (such as failing to display tuples and\ndictionaries correctly).  If the value being printed may be a tuple or\ndictionary, wrap it in a tuple.\n\nBytes objects ( bytes / bytearray ) have one unique built-in operation:\nthe % operator (modulo).\nThis is also known as the bytes formatting or interpolation operator.\nGiven format % values (where format is a bytes object), % conversion\nspecifications in format are replaced with zero or more elements of values .\nThe effect is similar to using the sprintf() in the C language.\n\nIf format requires a single argument, values may be a single non-tuple\nobject. [ 5 ] Otherwise, values must be a tuple with exactly the number of\nitems specified by the format bytes object, or a single mapping object (for\nexample, a dictionary).\n\nA conversion specifier contains two or more characters and has the following\ncomponents, which must occur in this order:\n\n- The '%' character, which marks the start of the specifier.\n- Mapping key (optional), consisting of a parenthesised sequence of characters\n(for example, (somename) ).\n- Conversion flags (optional), which affect the result of some conversion\ntypes.\n- Minimum field width (optional).  If specified as an '*' (asterisk), the\nactual width is read from the next element of the tuple in values , and the\nobject to convert comes after the minimum field width and optional precision.\n- Precision (optional), given as a '.' (dot) followed by the precision.  If\nspecified as '*' (an asterisk), the actual precision is read from the next\nelement of the tuple in values , and the value to convert comes after the\nprecision.\n- Length modifier (optional).\n- Conversion type.\n\nWhen the right argument is a dictionary (or other mapping type), then the\nformats in the bytes object must include a parenthesised mapping key into that\ndictionary inserted immediately after the '%' character. The mapping key\nselects the value to be formatted from the mapping.  For example:\n\n```python\n>>> print(b'%(language)s has %(number)03d quote types.' %\n...       {b'language': b\"Python\", b\"number\": 2})\nb'Python has 002 quote types.'\n```python\n\nIn this case no * specifiers may occur in a format (since they require a\nsequential parameter list).\n\nThe conversion flag characters are:\n\nA length modifier ( h , l , or L ) may be present, but is ignored as it\nis not necessary for Python \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so e.g. %ld is identical to %d .\n\nThe conversion types are:\n\nNotes:\n\n- The alternate form causes a leading octal specifier ( '0o' ) to be\ninserted before the first digit.\n- The alternate form causes a leading '0x' or '0X' (depending on whether\nthe 'x' or 'X' format was used) to be inserted before the first digit.\n- The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, even if\nno digits follow it. The precision determines the number of digits after the decimal point and\ndefaults to 6.\n- The alternate form causes the result to always contain a decimal point, and\ntrailing zeroes are not removed as they would otherwise be. The precision determines the number of significant digits before and after the\ndecimal point and defaults to 6.\n- If precision is N , the output is truncated to N characters.\n- b'%s' is deprecated, but will not be removed during the 3.x series.\n- b'%r' is deprecated, but will not be removed during the 3.x series.\n- See PEP 237 .\n\nNote\n\nThe bytearray version of this method does not operate in place - it\nalways produces a new object, even if no changes were made.\n\nSee also\n\nPEP 461 - Adding % formatting to bytes and bytearray\n\nAdded in version 3.5.\n\n### Memory Views\u00c2\u00b6\n\nmemoryview objects allow Python code to access the internal data\nof an object that supports the buffer protocol without\ncopying.\n\nclass\nmemoryview\n(\nobject\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nCreate a memoryview that references object . object must\nsupport the buffer protocol.  Built-in objects that support the buffer\nprotocol include bytes and bytearray .\n\nA memoryview has the notion of an element , which is the\natomic memory unit handled by the originating object .  For many simple\ntypes such as bytes and bytearray , an element is a single\nbyte, but other types such as array.array may have bigger elements.\n\nlen(view) is equal to the length of tolist , which\nis the nested list representation of the view. If view.ndim = 1 ,\nthis is equal to the number of elements in the view.\n\nChanged in version 3.12: If view.ndim == 0 , len(view) now raises TypeError instead of returning 1.\n\nThe itemsize attribute will give you the number of\nbytes in a single element.\n\nA memoryview supports slicing and indexing to expose its data.\nOne-dimensional slicing will result in a subview:\n\n```python\n>>> v = memoryview(b'abcefg')\n>>> v[1]\n98\n>>> v[-1]\n103\n>>> v[1:4]\n<memory at 0x7f3ddc9f4350>\n>>> bytes(v[1:4])\nb'bce'\n```python\n\nIf format is one of the native format specifiers\nfrom the struct module, indexing with an integer or a tuple of\nintegers is also supported and returns a single element with\nthe correct type.  One-dimensional memoryviews can be indexed\nwith an integer or a one-integer tuple.  Multi-dimensional memoryviews\ncan be indexed with tuples of exactly ndim integers where ndim is\nthe number of dimensions.  Zero-dimensional memoryviews can be indexed\nwith the empty tuple.\n\nHere is an example with a non-byte format:\n\n```python\n>>> import array\n>>> a = array.array('l', [-11111111, 22222222, -33333333, 44444444])\n>>> m = memoryview(a)\n>>> m[0]\n-11111111\n>>> m[-1]\n44444444\n>>> m[::2].tolist()\n[-11111111, -33333333]\n```python\n\nIf the underlying object is writable, the memoryview supports\none-dimensional slice assignment. Resizing is not allowed:\n\n```python\n>>> data = bytearray(b'abcefg')\n>>> v = memoryview(data)\n>>> v.readonly\nFalse\n>>> v[0] = ord(b'z')\n>>> data\nbytearray(b'zbcefg')\n>>> v[1:4] = b'123'\n>>> data\nbytearray(b'z123fg')\n>>> v[2:3] = b'spam'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nValueError: memoryview assignment: lvalue and rvalue have different structures\n>>> v[2:6] = b'spam'\n>>> data\nbytearray(b'z1spam')\n```python\n\nOne-dimensional memoryviews of hashable (read-only) types with formats\n\u00e2\u0080\u0098B\u00e2\u0080\u0099, \u00e2\u0080\u0098b\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098c\u00e2\u0080\u0099 are also hashable. The hash is defined as hash(m) == hash(m.tobytes()) :\n\n```python\n>>> v = memoryview(b'abcefg')\n>>> hash(v) == hash(b'abcefg')\nTrue\n>>> hash(v[2:4]) == hash(b'ce')\nTrue\n>>> hash(v[::-2]) == hash(b'abcefg'[::-2])\nTrue\n```python\n\nChanged in version 3.3: One-dimensional memoryviews can now be sliced.\nOne-dimensional memoryviews with formats \u00e2\u0080\u0098B\u00e2\u0080\u0099, \u00e2\u0080\u0098b\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098c\u00e2\u0080\u0099 are now hashable .\n\nChanged in version 3.4: memoryview is now registered automatically with collections.abc.Sequence\n\nChanged in version 3.5: memoryviews can now be indexed with tuple of integers.\n\nChanged in version 3.14: memoryview is now a generic type .\n\nmemoryview has several methods:\n\n__eq__\n(\nexporter\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nA memoryview and a PEP 3118 exporter are equal if their shapes are\nequivalent and if all corresponding values are equal when the operands\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nrespective format codes are interpreted using struct syntax.\n\nFor the subset of struct format strings currently supported by tolist() , v and w are equal if v.tolist() == w.tolist() :\n\n```python\n>>> import array\n>>> a = array.array('I', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n>>> b = array.array('d', [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])\n>>> c = array.array('b', [5, 3, 1])\n>>> x = memoryview(a)\n>>> y = memoryview(b)\n>>> x == a == y == b\nTrue\n>>> x.tolist() == a.tolist() == y.tolist() == b.tolist()\nTrue\n>>> z = y[::-2]\n>>> z == c\nTrue\n>>> z.tolist() == c.tolist()\nTrue\n```python\n\nIf either format string is not supported by the struct module,\nthen the objects will always compare as unequal (even if the format\nstrings and buffer contents are identical):\n\n```python\n>>> from ctypes import BigEndianStructure, c_long\n>>> class BEPoint(BigEndianStructure):\n...     _fields_ = [(\"x\", c_long), (\"y\", c_long)]\n...\n>>> point = BEPoint(100, 200)\n>>> a = memoryview(point)\n>>> b = memoryview(point)\n>>> a == point\nFalse\n>>> a == b\nFalse\n```python\n\nNote that, as with floating-point numbers, v is w does not imply v == w for memoryview objects.\n\nChanged in version 3.3: Previous versions compared the raw memory disregarding the item format\nand the logical array structure.\n\ntobytes\n(\norder\n=\n'C'\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the data in the buffer as a bytestring.

For contiguous\nviews, \u00e2\u0080\u0098A\u00e2\u0080\u0099 returns an exact copy of the physical memory. In particular,\nin-memory Fortran order is preserved. For non-contiguous views, the\ndata is converted to C first. order=None is the same as order=\u00e2\u0080\u0099C\u00e2\u0080\u0099 .\n\nhex\n(\n*\n,\nbytes_per_sep\n=\n1\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nhex\n(\nsep\n,\nbytes_per_sep\n=\n1\n)\nReturn a string object containing two hexadecimal digits for each\nbyte in the buffer.\n\n```python\n>>> m = memoryview(b\"abc\")\n>>> m.hex()\n'616263'\n```python\n\nAdded in version 3.5.\n\nChanged in version 3.8: Similar to bytes.hex() , memoryview.hex() now supports\noptional sep and bytes_per_sep parameters to insert separators\nbetween bytes in the hex output.\n\ntolist\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the data in the buffer as a list of elements.\n\n```python\n>>> memoryview(b'abc').tolist()\n[97, 98, 99]\n>>> import array\n>>> a = array.array('d', [1.1, 2.2, 3.3])\n>>> m = memoryview(a)\n>>> m.tolist()\n[1.1, 2.2, 3.3]\n```python\n\nChanged in version 3.3: tolist() now supports all single character native formats in struct module syntax as well as multi-dimensional\nrepresentations.\n\ntoreadonly\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a readonly version of the memoryview object.

If iterable is not specified, a new empty set is\nreturned.\n\nSets can be created by several means:\n\n- Use a comma-separated list of elements within braces: {'jack', 'sjoerd'}\n- Use a set comprehension: {c for c in 'abracadabra' if c not in 'abc'}\n- Use the type constructor: set() , set('foobar') , set(['a', 'b', 'foo'])\n\nInstances of set and frozenset provide the following\noperations:\n\nlen(s)\nReturn the number of elements in set s (cardinality of s ).\n\nx\nin\ns\nTest x for membership in s .\n\nx\nnot\nin\ns\nTest x for non-membership in s .\n\nfrozenset.\nisdisjoint\n(\nother\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset.\nisdisjoint\n(\nother\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn True if the set has no elements in common with other .  Sets are\ndisjoint if and only if their intersection is the empty set.\n\nfrozenset.\nissubset\n(\nother\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset.\nissubset\n(\nother\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset\n<=\nother\nTest whether every element in the set is in other .\n\nset\n<\nother\nTest whether the set is a proper subset of other , that is, set <= other and set != other .\n\nfrozenset.\nissuperset\n(\nother\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset.\nissuperset\n(\nother\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset\n>=\nother\nTest whether every element in other is in the set.\n\nset\n>\nother\nTest whether the set is a proper superset of other , that is, set >= other and set != other .\n\nfrozenset.\nunion\n(\n*\nothers\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset.\nunion\n(\n*\nothers\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset\n|\nother\n|\n...\nReturn a new set with elements from the set and all others.\n\nfrozenset.\nintersection\n(\n*\nothers\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset.\nintersection\n(\n*\nothers\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset\n&\nother\n&\n...\nReturn a new set with elements common to the set and all others.\n\nfrozenset.\ndifference\n(\n*\nothers\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset.\ndifference\n(\n*\nothers\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset\n-\nother\n-\n...\nReturn a new set with elements in the set that are not in the others.\n\nfrozenset.\nsymmetric_difference\n(\nother\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset.\nsymmetric_difference\n(\nother\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset\n^\nother\nReturn a new set with elements in either the set or other but not both.\n\nfrozenset.\ncopy\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset.\ncopy\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a shallow copy of the set.\n\nNote, the non-operator versions of union() , intersection() , difference() , symmetric_difference() , issubset() , and issuperset() methods will accept any iterable as an argument.  In\ncontrast, their operator based counterparts require their arguments to be\nsets.  This precludes error-prone constructions like set('abc') & 'cbs' in favor of the more readable set('abc').intersection('cbs') .\n\nBoth set and frozenset support set to set comparisons. Two\nsets are equal if and only if every element of each set is contained in the\nother (each is a subset of the other). A set is less than another set if and\nonly if the first set is a proper subset of the second set (is a subset, but\nis not equal). A set is greater than another set if and only if the first set\nis a proper superset of the second set (is a superset, but is not equal).\n\nInstances of set are compared to instances of frozenset based on their members.  For example, set('abc') == frozenset('abc') returns True and so does set('abc') in set([frozenset('abc')]) .\n\nThe subset and equality comparisons do not generalize to a total ordering\nfunction.  For example, any two nonempty disjoint sets are not equal and are not\nsubsets of each other, so all of the following return False : a<b , a==b , or a>b .\n\nSince sets only define partial ordering (subset relationships), the output of\nthe list.sort() method is undefined for lists of sets.\n\nSet elements, like dictionary keys, must be hashable .\n\nBinary operations that mix set instances with frozenset return the type of the first operand.  For example: frozenset('ab') | set('bc') returns an instance of frozenset .\n\nThe following table lists operations available for set that do not\napply to immutable instances of frozenset :\n\nset.\nupdate\n(\n*\nothers\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset\n|=\nother\n|\n...\nUpdate the set, adding elements from all others.\n\nset.\nintersection_update\n(\n*\nothers\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset\n&=\nother\n&\n...\nUpdate the set, keeping only elements found in it and all others.\n\nset.\ndifference_update\n(\n*\nothers\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset\n-=\nother\n|\n...\nUpdate the set, removing elements found in others.\n\nset.\nsymmetric_difference_update\n(\nother\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nset\n^=\nother\nUpdate the set, keeping only elements found in either set, but not in both.\n\nset.\nadd\n(\nelem\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nAdd element elem to the set.\n\nset.\nremove\n(\nelem\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nRemove element elem from the set.  Raises KeyError if elem is\nnot contained in the set.\n\nset.\ndiscard\n(\nelem\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nRemove element elem from the set if it is present.\n\nset.\npop\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nRemove and return an arbitrary element from the set.  Raises KeyError if the set is empty.\n\nset.\nclear\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nRemove all elements from the set.\n\nNote, the non-operator versions of the update() , intersection_update() , difference_update() , and symmetric_difference_update() methods will accept any iterable as an\nargument.\n\nNote, the elem argument to the __contains__() , remove() , and discard() methods may be a set.  To support searching for an equivalent\nfrozenset, a temporary one is created from elem .\n\n## Mapping Types \u00e2\u0080\u0094dict\u00c2\u00b6\n\nA mapping object maps hashable values to arbitrary objects.\nMappings are mutable objects.  There is currently only one standard mapping\ntype, the dictionary .  (For other containers see the built-in list , set , and tuple classes, and the collections module.)\n\nA dictionary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s keys are almost arbitrary values.  Values that are not hashable , that is, values containing lists, dictionaries or other\nmutable types (that are compared by value rather than by object identity) may\nnot be used as keys.\nValues that compare equal (such as 1 , 1.0 , and True )\ncan be used interchangeably to index the same dictionary entry.\n\nclass\ndict\n(\n**\nkwargs\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nclass\ndict\n(\nmapping\n,\n/\n,\n**\nkwargs\n)\nclass\ndict\n(\niterable\n,\n/\n,\n**\nkwargs\n)\nReturn a new dictionary initialized from an optional positional argument\nand a possibly empty set of keyword arguments.\n\nDictionaries can be created by several means:\n\n- Use a comma-separated list of key: value pairs within braces: {'jack': 4098, 'sjoerd': 4127} or {4098: 'jack', 4127: 'sjoerd'}\n- Use a dict comprehension: {} , {x: x ** 2 for x in range(10)}\n- Use the type constructor: dict() , dict([('foo', 100), ('bar', 200)]) , dict(foo=100, bar=200)\n\nIf no positional argument is given, an empty dictionary is created.\nIf a positional argument is given and it defines a keys() method, a\ndictionary is created by calling __getitem__() on the argument with\neach returned key from the method.  Otherwise, the positional argument must be an iterable object.  Each item in the iterable must itself be an iterable\nwith exactly two elements.  The first element of each item becomes a key in the\nnew dictionary, and the second element the corresponding value.  If a key occurs\nmore than once, the last value for that key becomes the corresponding value in\nthe new dictionary.\n\nIf keyword arguments are given, the keyword arguments and their values are\nadded to the dictionary created from the positional argument.  If a key\nbeing added is already present, the value from the keyword argument\nreplaces the value from the positional argument.\n\nDictionaries compare equal if and only if they have the same (key, value) pairs (regardless of ordering). Order comparisons (\u00e2\u0080\u0098<\u00e2\u0080\u0099, \u00e2\u0080\u0098<=\u00e2\u0080\u0099, \u00e2\u0080\u0098>=\u00e2\u0080\u0099, \u00e2\u0080\u0098>\u00e2\u0080\u0099) raise TypeError .  To illustrate dictionary creation and equality,\nthe following examples all return a dictionary equal to {\"one\": 1, \"two\": 2, \"three\": 3} :\n\n```python\n>>> a = dict(one=1, two=2, three=3)\n>>> b = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}\n>>> c = dict(zip(['one', 'two', 'three'], [1, 2, 3]))\n>>> d = dict([('two', 2), ('one', 1), ('three', 3)])\n>>> e = dict({'three': 3, 'one': 1, 'two': 2})\n>>> f = dict({'one': 1, 'three': 3}, two=2)\n>>> a == b == c == d == e == f\nTrue\n```python\n\nProviding keyword arguments as in the first example only works for keys that\nare valid Python identifiers.  Otherwise, any valid keys can be used.\n\nDictionaries preserve insertion order.  Note that updating a key does not\naffect the order.  Keys added after deletion are inserted at the end.\n\n```python\n>>> d = {\"one\": 1, \"two\": 2, \"three\": 3, \"four\": 4}\n>>> d\n{'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4}\n>>> list(d)\n['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']\n>>> list(d.values())\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\n>>> d[\"one\"] = 42\n>>> d\n{'one': 42, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4}\n>>> del d[\"two\"]\n>>> d[\"two\"] = None\n>>> d\n{'one': 42, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'two': None}\n```python\n\nChanged in version 3.7: Dictionary order is guaranteed to be insertion order.  This behavior was\nan implementation detail of CPython from 3.6.\n\nThese are the operations that dictionaries support (and therefore, custom\nmapping types should support too):\n\nlist(d)\nReturn a list of all the keys used in the dictionary d .\n\nlen(d)\nReturn the number of items in the dictionary d .\n\nd[key]\nReturn the item of d with key key .  Raises a KeyError if key is\nnot in the map.\n\nIf a subclass of dict defines a method __missing__() and key is not present, the d[key] operation calls that method with the key key as argument.  The d[key] operation then returns or raises whatever is\nreturned or raised by the __missing__(key) call.\nNo other operations or methods invoke __missing__() . If __missing__() is not defined, KeyError is raised. __missing__() must be a method; it cannot be an instance variable:\n\n```python\n>>> class Counter(dict):\n...     def __missing__(self, key):\n...         return 0\n...\n>>> c = Counter()\n>>> c['red']\n0\n>>> c['red'] += 1\n>>> c['red']\n1\n```python\n\nThe example above shows part of the implementation of collections.Counter .\nA different __missing__() method is used\nby collections.defaultdict .\n\nd[key]\n=\nvalue\nSet d[key] to value .\n\ndel\nd[key]\nRemove d[key] from d .  Raises a KeyError if key is not in the\nmap.\n\nkey\nin\nd\nReturn True if d has a key key , else False .\n\nkey\nnot\nin\nd\nEquivalent to not key in d .\n\niter(d)\nReturn an iterator over the keys of the dictionary.  This is a shortcut\nfor iter(d.keys()) .\n\nclear\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nRemove all items from the dictionary.\n\ncopy\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a shallow copy of the dictionary.\n\nclassmethod\nfromkeys\n(\niterable\n,\nvalue\n=\nNone\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nCreate a new dictionary with keys from iterable and values set to value .\n\nfromkeys() is a class method that returns a new dictionary. value defaults to None .  All of the values refer to just a single instance,\nso it generally doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make sense for value to be a mutable object\nsuch as an empty list.  To get distinct values, use a dict\ncomprehension instead.\n\nget\n(\nkey\n,\ndefault\n=\nNone\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default .\nIf default is not given, it defaults to None , so that this method\nnever raises a KeyError .\n\nitems\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a new view of the dictionary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s items ( (key, value) pairs).\nSee the documentation of view objects .\n\nkeys\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a new view of the dictionary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s keys.  See the documentation\nof view objects .\n\npop\n(\nkey\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\npop\n(\nkey\n,\ndefault\n,\n/\n)\nIf key is in the dictionary, remove it and return its value, else return default .  If default is not given and key is not in the dictionary,\na KeyError is raised.\n\npopitem\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nRemove and return a (key, value) pair from the dictionary.\nPairs are returned in LIFO order.\n\npopitem() is useful to destructively iterate over a dictionary, as\noften used in set algorithms.  If the dictionary is empty, calling popitem() raises a KeyError .\n\nChanged in version 3.7: LIFO order is now guaranteed. In prior versions, popitem() would\nreturn an arbitrary key/value pair.\n\nreversed(d)\nReturn a reverse iterator over the keys of the dictionary. This is a\nshortcut for reversed(d.keys()) .\n\nAdded in version 3.8.\n\nsetdefault\n(\nkey\n,\ndefault\n=\nNone\n,\n/\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nIf key is in the dictionary, return its value.

Return None .\n\nupdate() accepts either another object with a keys() method (in\nwhich case __getitem__() is called with every key returned from\nthe method) or an iterable of key/value pairs (as tuples or other iterables\nof length two). If keyword arguments are specified, the dictionary is then\nupdated with those key/value pairs: d.update(red=1, blue=2) .\n\nvalues\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nReturn a new view of the dictionary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s values.  See the documentation of view objects .\n\nAn equality comparison between one dict.values() view and another\nwill always return False . This also applies when comparing dict.values() to itself:\n\n```python\n>>> d = {'a': 1}\n>>> d.values() == d.values()\nFalse\n```python\n\nd\n|\nother\nCreate a new dictionary with the merged keys and values of d and other , which must both be dictionaries.

The\nvalues of other take priority when d and other share keys.\n\nAdded in version 3.9.\n\nDictionaries and dictionary views are reversible.\n\n```python\n>>> d = {\"one\": 1, \"two\": 2, \"three\": 3, \"four\": 4}\n>>> d\n{'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4}\n>>> list(reversed(d))\n['four', 'three', 'two', 'one']\n>>> list(reversed(d.values()))\n[4, 3, 2, 1]\n>>> list(reversed(d.items()))\n[('four', 4), ('three', 3), ('two', 2), ('one', 1)]\n```python\n\nChanged in version 3.8: Dictionaries are now reversible.\n\nSee also\n\ntypes.MappingProxyType can be used to create a read-only view\nof a dict .\n\nThread safety for dict objects\n\nCreating a dictionary with the dict constructor is atomic when the\nargument to it is a dict or a tuple . When using the dict.fromkeys() method, dictionary creation is atomic when the\nargument is a dict , tuple , set or frozenset .\n\nThe following operations and functions are lock-free and atomic .\n\n```python\nd[key]       # dict.__getitem__\nd.get(key)   # dict.get\nkey in d     # dict.__contains__\nlen(d)       # dict.__len__\n```python\n\nAll other operations from here on hold the per-object lock .\n\nWriting or removing a single item is safe to call from multiple threads\nand will not corrupt the dictionary:\n\n```python\nd[key] = value        # write\ndel d[key]            # delete\nd.pop(key)            # remove and return\nd.popitem()           # remove and return last item\nd.setdefault(key, v)  # insert if missing\n```python\n\nThese operations may compare keys using __eq__() , which can\nexecute arbitrary Python code. During such comparisons, the dictionary may\nbe modified by another thread. For built-in types like str , int , and float , that implement __eq__() in C,\nthe underlying lock is not released during comparisons and this is not a\nconcern.\n\nThe following operations return new objects and hold the per-object lock for the duration of the operation:\n\n```python\nd.copy()      # returns a shallow copy of the dictionary\nd | other     # merges two dicts into a new dict\nd.keys()      # returns a new dict_keys view object\nd.values()    # returns a new dict_values view object\nd.items()     # returns a new dict_items view object\n```python\n\nThe clear() method holds the lock for its duration. Other\nthreads cannot observe elements being removed.\n\nThe following operations lock both dictionaries. For update() and |= , this applies only when the other operand is a dict that uses the standard dict iterator (but not subclasses that override\niteration). For equality comparison, this applies to dict and\nits subclasses:\n\n```python\nd.update(other_dict)  # both locked when other_dict is a dict\nd |= other_dict       # both locked when other_dict is a dict\nd == other_dict       # both locked for dict and subclasses\n```python\n\nAll comparison operations also compare values using __eq__() ,\nso for non-built-in types the lock may be released during comparison.\n\nfromkeys() locks both the new dictionary and the iterable\nwhen the iterable is exactly a dict , set , or frozenset (not subclasses):\n\n```python\ndict.fromkeys(a_dict)      # locks both\ndict.fromkeys(a_set)       # locks both\ndict.fromkeys(a_frozenset) # locks both\n```python\n\nWhen updating from a non-dict iterable, only the target dictionary is\nlocked. The iterable may be concurrently modified by another thread:\n\n```python\nd.update(iterable)        # iterable is not a dict: only d locked\nd |= iterable             # iterable is not a dict: only d locked\ndict.fromkeys(iterable)   # iterable is not a dict/set/frozenset: only result locked\n```python\n\nOperations that involve multiple accesses, as well as iteration, are never\natomic:\n\n```python\n# NOT atomic: read-modify-write\nd[key] = d[key] + 1\n\n# NOT atomic: check-then-act (TOCTOU)\nif key in d:\n      del d[key]\n\n# NOT thread-safe: iteration while modifying\nfor key, value in d.items():\n      process(key)  # another thread may modify d\n```python\n\nTo avoid time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) issues, use atomic\noperations or handle exceptions:\n\n```python\n# Use pop() with default instead of check-then-delete\nd.pop(key, None)\n\n# Or handle the exception\ntry:\n      del d[key]\nexcept KeyError:\n      pass\n```python\n\nTo safely iterate over a dictionary that may be modified by another\nthread, iterate over a copy:\n\n```python\n# Make a copy to iterate safely\nfor key, value in d.copy().items():\n      process(key)\n```python\n\nConsider external synchronization when sharing dict instances\nacross threads. See Python support for free threading for more information.\n\n### Dictionary view objects\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe objects returned by dict.keys() , dict.values() and dict.items() are view objects .  They provide a dynamic view on the\ndictionary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entries, which means that when the dictionary changes, the view\nreflects these changes.\n\nDictionary views can be iterated over to yield their respective data, and\nsupport membership tests:\n\nlen(dictview)\nReturn the number of entries in the dictionary.\n\niter(dictview)\nReturn an iterator over the keys, values or items (represented as tuples of (key, value) ) in the dictionary.\n\nKeys and values are iterated over in insertion order.\nThis allows the creation of (value, key) pairs\nusing zip() : pairs = zip(d.values(), d.keys()) .  Another way to\ncreate the same list is pairs = [(v, k) for (k, v) in d.items()] .\n\nIterating views while adding or deleting entries in the dictionary may raise\na RuntimeError or fail to iterate over all entries.\n\nChanged in version 3.7: Dictionary order is guaranteed to be insertion order.\n\nx\nin\ndictview\nReturn True if x is in the underlying dictionary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s keys, values or\nitems (in the latter case, x should be a (key, value) tuple).\n\nreversed(dictview)\nReturn a reverse iterator over the keys, values or items of the dictionary.\nThe view will be iterated in reverse order of the insertion.\n\nChanged in version 3.8: Dictionary views are now reversible.\n\ndictview.mapping\nReturn a types.MappingProxyType that wraps the original\ndictionary to which the view refers.\n\nAdded in version 3.10.\n\nKeys views are set-like since their entries are unique and hashable .\nItems views also have set-like operations since the (key, value) pairs\nare unique and the keys are hashable.\nIf all values in an items view are hashable as well,\nthen the items view can interoperate with other sets.\n(Values views are not treated as set-like\nsince the entries are generally not unique.)  For set-like views, all of the\noperations defined for the abstract base class collections.abc.Set are\navailable (for example, == , < , or ^ ).  While using set operators,\nset-like views accept any iterable as the other operand,\nunlike sets which only accept sets as the input.\n\nAn example of dictionary view usage:\n\n```python\n>>> dishes = {'eggs': 2, 'sausage': 1, 'bacon': 1, 'spam': 500}\n>>> keys = dishes.keys()\n>>> values = dishes.values()\n\n>>> # iteration\n>>> n = 0\n>>> for val in values:\n...     n += val\n...\n>>> print(n)\n504\n\n>>> # keys and values are iterated over in the same order (insertion order)\n>>> list(keys)\n['eggs', 'sausage', 'bacon', 'spam']\n>>> list(values)\n[2, 1, 1, 500]\n\n>>> # view objects are dynamic and reflect dict changes\n>>> del dishes['eggs']\n>>> del dishes['sausage']\n>>> list(keys)\n['bacon', 'spam']\n\n>>> # set operations\n>>> keys & {'eggs', 'bacon', 'salad'}\n{'bacon'}\n>>> keys ^ {'sausage', 'juice'} == {'juice', 'sausage', 'bacon', 'spam'}\nTrue\n>>> keys | ['juice', 'juice', 'juice'] == {'bacon', 'spam', 'juice'}\nTrue\n\n>>> # get back a read-only proxy for the original dictionary\n>>> values.mapping\nmappingproxy({'bacon': 1, 'spam': 500})\n>>> values.mapping['spam']\n500\n```python\n\n## Context Manager Types\u00c2\u00b6\n\nPython\u00e2\u0080\u0099s with statement supports the concept of a runtime context\ndefined by a context manager.  This is implemented using a pair of methods\nthat allow user-defined classes to define a runtime context that is entered\nbefore the statement body is executed and exited when the statement ends:\n\ncontextmanager.\n__enter__\n(\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nEnter the runtime context and return either this object or another object\nrelated to the runtime context. The value returned by this method is bound to\nthe identifier in the as clause of with statements using\nthis context manager.\n\nAn example of a context manager that returns itself is a file object .\nFile objects return themselves from __enter__() to allow open() to be\nused as the context expression in a with statement.\n\nAn example of a context manager that returns a related object is the one\nreturned by decimal.localcontext() . These managers set the active\ndecimal context to a copy of the original decimal context and then return the\ncopy. This allows changes to be made to the current decimal context in the body\nof the with statement without affecting code outside the with statement.\n\ncontextmanager.\n__exit__\n(\nexc_type\n,\nexc_val\n,\nexc_tb\n)\n\u00c2\u00b6\nExit the runtime context and return a Boolean flag indicating if any exception\nthat occurred should be suppressed. If an exception occurred while executing the\nbody of the with statement, the arguments contain the exception type,\nvalue and traceback information. Otherwise, all three arguments are None .\n\nReturning a true value from this method will cause the with statement\nto suppress the exception and continue execution with the statement immediately\nfollowing the with statement. Otherwise the exception continues\npropagating after this method has finished executing.\n\nIf this method raises an exception while handling an earlier exception from the with block, the new exception is raised, and the original exception\nis stored in its __context__ attribute.\n\nThe exception passed in should never be reraised explicitly - instead, this\nmethod should return a false value to indicate that the method completed\nsuccessfully and does not want to suppress the raised exception. This allows\ncontext management code to easily detect whether or not an __exit__() method has actually failed.\n\nPython defines several context managers to support easy thread synchronisation,\nprompt closure of files or other objects, and simpler manipulation of the active\ndecimal arithmetic context. The specific types are not treated specially beyond\ntheir implementation of the context management protocol. See the contextlib module for some examples.\n\nPython\u00e2\u0080\u0099s generator s and the contextlib.contextmanager decorator\nprovide a convenient way to implement these protocols.  If a generator function is\ndecorated with the contextlib.contextmanager decorator, it will return a\ncontext manager implementing the necessary __enter__() and __exit__() methods, rather than the iterator produced by an\nundecorated generator function.\n\nNote that there is no specific slot for any of these methods in the type\nstructure for Python objects in the Python/C API. Extension types wanting to\ndefine these methods must provide them as a normal Python accessible method.\nCompared to the overhead of setting up the runtime context, the overhead of a\nsingle class dictionary lookup is negligible.\n\n## Type Annotation Types \u00e2\u0080\u0094Generic Alias,Union\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe core built-in types for type annotations are Generic Alias and Union .\n\n### Generic Alias Type\u00c2\u00b6\n\nGenericAlias objects are generally created by subscripting a class. They are most often used with container classes , such as list or dict . For example, list[int] is a GenericAlias object created\nby subscripting the list class with the argument int . GenericAlias objects are intended primarily for use with type annotations .\n\nNote\n\nIt is generally only possible to subscript a class if the class implements\nthe special method __class_getitem__() .\n\nA GenericAlias object acts as a proxy for a generic type ,\nimplementing parameterized generics .\n\nFor a container class, the\nargument(s) supplied to a subscription of the class may\nindicate the type(s) of the elements an object contains. For example, set[bytes] can be used in type annotations to signify a set in\nwhich all the elements are of type bytes .\n\nFor a class which defines __class_getitem__() but is not a\ncontainer, the argument(s) supplied to a subscription of the class will often\nindicate the return type(s) of one or more methods defined on an object. For\nexample, regular expressions can be used on both the str data\ntype and the bytes data type:\n\n- If x = re.search('foo', 'foo') , x will be a re.Match object where the return values of x.group(0) and x[0] will both be of type str . We can\nrepresent this kind of object in type annotations with the GenericAlias re.Match[str] .\n- If y = re.search(b'bar', b'bar') , (note the b for bytes ), y will also be an instance of re.Match , but the return\nvalues of y.group(0) and y[0] will both be of type bytes . In type annotations, we would represent this\nvariety of re.Match objects with re.Match[bytes] .\n\nGenericAlias objects are instances of the class types.GenericAlias , which can also be used to create GenericAlias objects directly.\n\nT[X,\nY,\n...]\nCreates a GenericAlias representing a type T parameterized by types X , Y , and more depending on the T used.\nFor example, a function expecting a list containing float elements:\n\n```python\ndef average(values: list[float]) -> float:\n    return sum(values) / len(values)\n```python\n\nAnother example for mapping objects, using a dict , which\nis a generic type expecting two type parameters representing the key type\nand the value type.  In this example, the function expects a dict with\nkeys of type str and values of type int :\n\n```python\ndef send_post_request(url: str, body: dict[str, int]) -> None:\n    ...\n```python\n\nThe builtin functions isinstance() and issubclass() do not accept GenericAlias types for their second argument:\n\n```python\n>>> isinstance([1, 2], list[str])\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: isinstance() argument 2 cannot be a parameterized generic\n```python\n\nThe Python runtime does not enforce type annotations .\nThis extends to generic types and their type parameters. When creating\na container object from a GenericAlias , the elements in the container are not checked\nagainst their type. For example, the following code is discouraged, but will\nrun without errors:\n\n```python\n>>> t = list[str]\n>>> t([1, 2, 3])\n[1, 2, 3]\n```python\n\nFurthermore, parameterized generics erase type parameters during object\ncreation:\n\n```python\n>>> t = list[str]\n>>> type(t)\n<class 'types.GenericAlias'>\n\n>>> l = t()\n>>> type(l)\n<class 'list'>\n```python\n\nCalling repr() or str() on a generic shows the parameterized type:\n\n```python\n>>> repr(list[int])\n'list[int]'\n\n>>> str(list[int])\n'list[int]'\n```python\n\nThe __getitem__() method of generic containers will raise an\nexception to disallow mistakes like dict[str][str] :\n\n```python\n>>> dict[str][str]\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  ...\nTypeError: dict[str] is not a generic class\n```python\n\nHowever, such expressions are valid when type variables are\nused.  The index must have as many elements as there are type variable items\nin the GenericAlias object\u00e2\u0080\u0099s __args__ .\n\n```python\n>>> from typing import TypeVar\n>>> Y = TypeVar('Y')\n>>> dict[str, Y][int]\ndict[str, int]\n```python\n\n#### Standard Generic Classes\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe following standard library classes support parameterized generics. This\nlist is non-exhaustive.\n\n- tuple\n- list\n- dict\n- set\n- frozenset\n- type\n- asyncio.Future\n- asyncio.Task\n- collections.deque\n- collections.defaultdict\n- collections.OrderedDict\n- collections.Counter\n- collections.ChainMap\n- collections.abc.Awaitable\n- collections.abc.Coroutine\n- collections.abc.AsyncIterable\n- collections.abc.AsyncIterator\n- collections.abc.AsyncGenerator\n- collections.abc.Iterable\n- collections.abc.Iterator\n- collections.abc.Generator\n- collections.abc.Reversible\n- collections.abc.Container\n- collections.abc.Collection\n- collections.abc.Callable\n- collections.abc.Set\n- collections.abc.MutableSet\n- collections.abc.Mapping\n- collections.abc.MutableMapping\n- collections.abc.Sequence\n- collections.abc.MutableSequence\n- collections.abc.ByteString\n- collections.abc.MappingView\n- collections.abc.KeysView\n- collections.abc.ItemsView\n- collections.abc.ValuesView\n- contextlib.AbstractContextManager\n- contextlib.AbstractAsyncContextManager\n- dataclasses.Field\n- functools.cached_property\n- functools.partialmethod\n- os.PathLike\n- queue.LifoQueue\n- queue.Queue\n- queue.PriorityQueue\n- queue.SimpleQueue\n- re.Pattern\n- re.Match\n- shelve.BsdDbShelf\n- shelve.DbfilenameShelf\n- shelve.Shelf\n- types.MappingProxyType\n- weakref.WeakKeyDictionary\n- weakref.WeakMethod\n- weakref.WeakSet\n- weakref.WeakValueDictionary\n\n#### Special Attributes ofGenericAliasobjects\u00c2\u00b6\n\nAll parameterized generics implement special read-only attributes.\n\ngenericalias.\n__origin__\n\u00c2\u00b6\nThis attribute points at the non-parameterized generic class:\n\n```python\n>>> list[int].__origin__\n<class 'list'>\n```python\n\ngenericalias.\n__args__\n\u00c2\u00b6\nThis attribute is a tuple (possibly of length 1) of generic\ntypes passed to the original __class_getitem__() of the\ngeneric class:\n\n```python\n>>> dict[str, list[int]].__args__\n(<class 'str'>, list[int])\n```python\n\ngenericalias.\n__parameters__\n\u00c2\u00b6\nThis attribute is a lazily computed tuple (possibly empty) of unique type\nvariables found in __args__ :\n\n```python\n>>> from typing import TypeVar\n\n>>> T = TypeVar('T')\n>>> list[T].__parameters__\n(~T,)\n```python\n\nNote\n\nA GenericAlias object with typing.ParamSpec parameters may not\nhave correct __parameters__ after substitution because typing.ParamSpec is intended primarily for static type checking.\n\ngenericalias.\n__unpacked__\n\u00c2\u00b6\nA boolean that is true if the alias has been unpacked using the * operator (see TypeVarTuple ).\n\nAdded in version 3.11.\n\nSee also\n\nPEP 484\n- Type Hints\nIntroducing Python\u00e2\u0080\u0099s framework for type annotations.\n\nPEP 585\n- Type Hinting Generics In Standard Collections\nIntroducing the ability to natively parameterize standard-library\nclasses, provided they implement the special class method __class_getitem__() .\n\nGenerics\n,\nuser-defined generics\nand\n`typing.Generic`\nDocumentation on how to implement generic classes that can be\nparameterized at runtime and understood by static type-checkers.\n\nAdded in version 3.9.\n\n### Union Type\u00c2\u00b6\n\nA union object holds the value of the | (bitwise or) operation on\nmultiple type objects .  These types are intended\nprimarily for type annotations . The union type expression\nenables cleaner type hinting syntax compared to subscripting typing.Union .\n\nX\n|\nY\n|\n...\nDefines a union object which holds types X , Y , and so forth. X | Y means either X or Y.  It is equivalent to typing.Union[X, Y] .\nFor example, the following function expects an argument of type int or float :\n\n```python\ndef square(number: int | float) -> int | float:\n    return number ** 2\n```python\n\nNote\n\nThe | operand cannot be used at runtime to define unions where one or\nmore members is a forward reference. For example, int | \"Foo\" , where \"Foo\" is a reference to a class not yet defined, will fail at\nruntime. For unions which include forward references, present the\nwhole expression as a string, e.g. \"int | Foo\" .\n\nunion_object\n==\nother\nUnion objects can be tested for equality with other union objects.  Details:\n\n- Unions of unions are flattened: ( int | str ) | float == int | str | float\n- Redundant types are removed: int | str | int == int | str\n- When comparing unions, the order is ignored: int | str == str | int\n- It creates instances of typing.Union : int | str == typing . Union [ int , str ] type ( int | str ) is typing . Union\n- Optional types can be spelled as a union with None : str | None == typing . Optional [ str ]\n\nisinstance(obj,\nunion_object)\nissubclass(obj,\nunion_object)\nCalls to isinstance() and issubclass() are also supported with a\nunion object:\n\n```python\n>>> isinstance(\"\", int | str)\nTrue\n```python\n\nHowever, parameterized generics in\nunion objects cannot be checked:\n\n```python\n>>> isinstance(1, int | list[int])  # short-circuit evaluation\nTrue\n>>> isinstance([1], int | list[int])\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  ...\nTypeError: isinstance() argument 2 cannot be a parameterized generic\n```python\n\nThe user-exposed type for the union object can be accessed from typing.Union and used for isinstance() checks:\n\n```python\n>>> import typing\n>>> isinstance(int | str, typing.Union)\nTrue\n>>> typing.Union()\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nTypeError: cannot create 'typing.Union' instances\n```python\n\nNote\n\nThe __or__() method for type objects was added to support the syntax X | Y .  If a metaclass implements __or__() , the Union may\noverride it:\n\n```python\n>>> class M(type):\n...     def __or__(self, other):\n...         return \"Hello\"\n...\n>>> class C(metaclass=M):\n...     pass\n...\n>>> C | int\n'Hello'\n>>> int | C\nint | C\n```python\n\nSee also\n\nPEP 604 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 PEP proposing the X | Y syntax and the Union type.\n\nAdded in version 3.10.\n\nChanged in version 3.14: Union objects are now instances of typing.Union . Previously, they were instances\nof types.UnionType , which remains an alias for typing.Union .\n\n## Other Built-in Types\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe interpreter supports several other kinds of objects. Most of these support\nonly one or two operations.\n\n### Modules\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe only special operation on a module is attribute access: m.name , where m is a module and name accesses a name defined in m \u00e2\u0080\u0099s symbol table.\nModule attributes can be assigned to.  (Note that the import statement is not, strictly speaking, an operation on a module object; import foo does not require a module object named foo to exist, rather it requires\nan (external) definition for a module named foo somewhere.)\n\nA special attribute of every module is __dict__ . This is the\ndictionary containing the module\u00e2\u0080\u0099s symbol table. Modifying this dictionary will\nactually change the module\u00e2\u0080\u0099s symbol table, but direct assignment to the __dict__ attribute is not possible (you can write m.__dict__['a'] = 1 , which defines m.a to be 1 , but you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t write m.__dict__ = {} ).  Modifying __dict__ directly is\nnot recommended.\n\nModules built into the interpreter are written like this: <module 'sys' (built-in)> .  If loaded from a file, they are written as <module 'os' from '/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/os.pyc'> .\n\n### Classes and Class Instances\u00c2\u00b6\n\nSee Objects, values and types and Class definitions for these.\n\n### Functions\u00c2\u00b6\n\nFunction objects are created by function definitions.  The only operation on a\nfunction object is to call it: func(argument-list) .\n\nThere are really two flavors of function objects: built-in functions and\nuser-defined functions.  Both support the same operation (to call the function),\nbut the implementation is different, hence the different object types.\n\nSee Function definitions for more information.\n\n### Methods\u00c2\u00b6\n\nMethods are functions that are called using the attribute notation.\nThere are two flavors: built-in methods (such as append() on lists)\nand class instance method .\nBuilt-in methods are described with the types that support them.\n\nIf you access a method (a function defined in a class namespace) through an\ninstance, you get a special object: a bound method (also called instance method ) object. When called, it will add\nthe self argument\nto the argument list.  Bound methods have two special read-only attributes: m.__self__ is the object on which the method\noperates, and m.__func__ is\nthe function implementing the method.  Calling m(arg-1, arg-2, ..., arg-n) is completely equivalent to calling m.__func__(m.__self__, arg-1, arg-2, ..., arg-n) .\n\nLike function objects , bound method objects support\ngetting arbitrary\nattributes.  However, since method attributes are actually stored on the\nunderlying function object ( method.__func__ ), setting method attributes on\nbound methods is disallowed.  Attempting to set an attribute on a method\nresults in an AttributeError being raised.  In order to set a method\nattribute, you need to explicitly set it on the underlying function object:\n\n```python\n>>> class C:\n...     def method(self):\n...         pass\n...\n>>> c = C()\n>>> c.method.whoami = 'my name is method'  # can't set on the method\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\nAttributeError: 'method' object has no attribute 'whoami'\n>>> c.method.__func__.whoami = 'my name is method'\n>>> c.method.whoami\n'my name is method'\n```python\n\nSee Instance methods for more information.\n\n### Code Objects\u00c2\u00b6\n\nCode objects are used by the implementation to represent \u00e2\u0080\u009cpseudo-compiled\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nexecutable Python code such as a function body. They differ from function\nobjects because they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t contain a reference to their global execution\nenvironment.  Code objects are returned by the built-in compile() function\nand can be extracted from function objects through their __code__ attribute. See also the code module.\n\nAccessing __code__ raises an auditing event object.__getattr__ with arguments obj and \"__code__\" .\n\nA code object can be executed or evaluated by passing it (instead of a source\nstring) to the exec() or eval() built-in functions.\n\nSee The standard type hierarchy for more information.\n\n### Type Objects\u00c2\u00b6\n\nType objects represent the various object types.  An object\u00e2\u0080\u0099s type is accessed\nby the built-in function type() .  There are no special operations on\ntypes.  The standard module types defines names for all standard built-in\ntypes.\n\nTypes are written like this: <class 'int'> .\n\n### The Null Object\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThis object is returned by functions that don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t explicitly return a value.  It\nsupports no special operations.  There is exactly one null object, named None (a built-in name). type(None)() produces the same singleton.\n\nIt is written as None .\n\n### The Ellipsis Object\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThis object is commonly used to indicate that something is omitted.\nIt supports no special operations.  There is exactly one ellipsis object, named Ellipsis (a built-in name). type(Ellipsis)() produces the Ellipsis singleton.\n\nIt is written as Ellipsis or ... .\n\nIn typical use, ... as the Ellipsis object appears in a few different\nplaces, for instance:\n\n- In type annotations, such as callable arguments or tuple elements .\n- As the body of a function instead of a pass statement .\n- In third-party libraries, such as Numpy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slicing and striding .\n\nPython also uses three dots in ways that are not Ellipsis objects, for instance:\n\n- Doctest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ELLIPSIS , as a pattern for missing content.\n- The default Python prompt of the interactive shell when partial input is incomplete.\n\nLastly, the Python documentation often uses three dots in conventional English\nusage to mean omitted content, even in code examples that also use them as the Ellipsis .\n\n### The NotImplemented Object\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThis object is returned from comparisons and binary operations when they are\nasked to operate on types they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t support. See Comparisons for more\ninformation.  There is exactly one NotImplemented object. type(NotImplemented)() produces the singleton instance.\n\nIt is written as NotImplemented .\n\n### Internal Objects\u00c2\u00b6\n\nSee The standard type hierarchy for this information.  It describes stack frame objects , traceback objects , and slice objects.\n\n## Special Attributes\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe implementation adds a few special read-only attributes to several object\ntypes, where they are relevant.  Some of these are not reported by the dir() built-in function.\n\ndefinition.\n__name__\n\u00c2\u00b6\nThe name of the class, function, method, descriptor, or\ngenerator instance.\n\ndefinition.\n__qualname__\n\u00c2\u00b6\nThe qualified name of the class, function, method, descriptor,\nor generator instance.\n\nAdded in version 3.3.\n\ndefinition.\n__module__\n\u00c2\u00b6\nThe name of the module in which a class or function was defined.\n\ndefinition.\n__doc__\n\u00c2\u00b6\nThe documentation string of a class or function, or None if undefined.\n\ndefinition.\n__type_params__\n\u00c2\u00b6\nThe type parameters of generic classes, functions,\nand type aliases . For classes and functions that\nare not generic, this will be an empty tuple.\n\nAdded in version 3.12.\n\n## Integer string conversion length limitation\u00c2\u00b6\n\nCPython has a global limit for converting between int and str to mitigate denial of service attacks. This limit only applies to decimal or\nother non-power-of-two number bases. Hexadecimal, octal, and binary conversions\nare unlimited. The limit can be configured.\n\nThe int type in CPython is an arbitrary length number stored in binary\nform (commonly known as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbignum\u00e2\u0080\u009d). There exists no algorithm that can convert\na string to a binary integer or a binary integer to a string in linear time, unless the base is a power of 2. Even the best known algorithms for base 10\nhave sub-quadratic complexity. Converting a large value such as int('1' * 500_000) can take over a second on a fast CPU.\n\nLimiting conversion size offers a practical way to avoid CVE 2020-10735 .\n\nThe limit is applied to the number of digit characters in the input or output\nstring when a non-linear conversion algorithm would be involved.  Underscores\nand the sign are not counted towards the limit.\n\nWhen an operation would exceed the limit, a ValueError is raised:\n\n```python\n>>> import sys\n>>> sys.set_int_max_str_digits(4300)  # Illustrative, this is the default.\n>>> _ = int('2' * 5432)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n...\nValueError: Exceeds the limit (4300 digits) for integer string conversion: value has 5432 digits; use sys.set_int_max_str_digits() to increase the limit\n>>> i = int('2' * 4300)\n>>> len(str(i))\n4300\n>>> i_squared = i*i\n>>> len(str(i_squared))\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n...\nValueError: Exceeds the limit (4300 digits) for integer string conversion; use sys.set_int_max_str_digits() to increase the limit\n>>> len(hex(i_squared))\n7144\n>>> assert int(hex(i_squared), base=16) == i*i  # Hexadecimal is unlimited.\n```python\n\nThe default limit is 4300 digits as provided in sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits .\nThe lowest limit that can be configured is 640 digits as provided in sys.int_info.str_digits_check_threshold .\n\nVerification:\n\n```python\n>>> import sys\n>>> assert sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits == 4300, sys.int_info\n>>> assert sys.int_info.str_digits_check_threshold == 640, sys.int_info\n>>> msg = int('578966293710682886880994035146873798396722250538762761564'\n...           '9252925514383915483333812743580549779436104706260696366600'\n...           '571186405732').to_bytes(53, 'big')\n...\n```python\n\nAdded in version 3.11.\n\n### Affected APIs\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe limitation only applies to potentially slow conversions between int and str or bytes :\n\n- int(string) with default base 10.\n- int(string, base) for all bases that are not a power of 2.\n- str(integer) .\n- repr(integer) .\n- any other string conversion to base 10, for example f\"{integer}\" , \"{}\".format(integer) , or b\"%d\" % integer .\n\nThe limitations do not apply to functions with a linear algorithm:\n\n- int(string, base) with base 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32.\n- int.from_bytes() and int.to_bytes() .\n- hex() , oct() , bin() .\n- Format Specification Mini-Language for hex, octal, and binary numbers.\n- str to float .\n- str to decimal.Decimal .\n\n### Configuring the limit\u00c2\u00b6\n\nBefore Python starts up you can use an environment variable or an interpreter\ncommand line flag to configure the limit:\n\n- PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS , e.g. PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS=640 python3 to set the limit to 640 or PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS=0 python3 to disable the limitation.\n- -X int_max_str_digits , e.g. python3 -X int_max_str_digits=640\n- sys.flags.int_max_str_digits contains the value of PYTHONINTMAXSTRDIGITS or -X int_max_str_digits .\nIf both the env var and the -X option are set, the -X option takes\nprecedence. A value of -1 indicates that both were unset, thus a value of sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits was used during initialization.\n\nFrom code, you can inspect the current limit and set a new one using these sys APIs:\n\n- sys.get_int_max_str_digits() and sys.set_int_max_str_digits() are\na getter and setter for the interpreter-wide limit. Subinterpreters have\ntheir own limit.\n\nInformation about the default and minimum can be found in sys.int_info :\n\n- sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits is the compiled-in\ndefault limit.\n- sys.int_info.str_digits_check_threshold is the lowest\naccepted value for the limit (other than 0 which disables it).\n\nAdded in version 3.11.\n\nCaution\n\nSetting a low limit can lead to problems. While rare, code exists that\ncontains integer constants in decimal in their source that exceed the\nminimum threshold. A consequence of setting the limit is that Python source\ncode containing decimal integer literals longer than the limit will\nencounter an error during parsing, usually at startup time or import time or\neven at installation time - anytime an up to date .pyc does not already\nexist for the code. A workaround for source that contains such large\nconstants is to convert them to 0x hexadecimal form as it has no limit.\n\nTest your application thoroughly if you use a low limit. Ensure your tests\nrun with the limit set early via the environment or flag so that it applies\nduring startup and even during any installation step that may invoke Python\nto precompile .py sources to .pyc files.\n\n### Recommended configuration\u00c2\u00b6\n\nThe default sys.int_info.default_max_str_digits is expected to be\nreasonable for most applications. If your application requires a different\nlimit, set it from your main entry point using Python version agnostic code as\nthese APIs were added in security patch releases in versions before 3.12.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\n>>> import sys\n>>> if hasattr(sys, \"set_int_max_str_digits\"):\n...     upper_bound = 68000\n...     lower_bound = 4004\n...     current_limit = sys.get_int_max_str_digits()\n...     if current_limit == 0 or current_limit > upper_bound:\n...         sys.set_int_max_str_digits(upper_bound)\n...     elif current_limit < lower_bound:\n...         sys.set_int_max_str_digits(lower_bound)\n```python\n\nIf you need to disable it entirely, set it to 0 .\n\nFootnotes",
